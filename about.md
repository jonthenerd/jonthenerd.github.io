Hi. I'm Jon Badgett.

I'm a software developer, currently employed supervising SharePoint development. I value honesty,
quality, and well-thought-out concepts.

I live and work in the Conroe, TX area (The Woodlands). 

The technologies I'm most interested in right now are:

* Jekyll
* .Net Core
* SASS

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, cooking and eating good food, 
video games, and general tinkering.
