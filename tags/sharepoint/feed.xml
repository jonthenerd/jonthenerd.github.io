      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next in this series on the SharePoint Framework are extensions.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/extensions/overview-extensions&#34;&gt;According to docs.microsoft.com, SPFx Extensions allow for the customization of multiple facets of the SharePoint experience&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on differences I made while following the online tutorial and my
observations on capabilities and impacts of SPFx Application Customizer
extensions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SharePoint 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve created some site columns, added them to a content type, then added
that content type to a list/library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You add some test data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a full crawl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create managed properties, mapping them to the crawled properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run another full crawl (to populate the managed properties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed properties on search results are missing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do now?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We ran across an issue in a test environment where we were unable to add items
to a list, or a document library. However, you could use Windows explorer view
to upload a document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific error message seen was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;The server was unable to save the form at this time. Please try again.

      <description>When using the stsadm command:
stsadm.exe -o migrateuser oldlogin &amp;ldquo;domainusername&amp;rdquo; -newlogin &amp;ldquo;domainnewusername&amp;rdquo;
We received this error message:
Value cannot be null. Parameter name: userProfileApplicationProxy
If you look in the ULS logs, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that there is an Access Denied event occuring. We were able to resolve this by going into Central Administration, selecting the User Service Application, and ensuring that the administrator account being used to run the above command has Full Control rights to the Service Application.</description>

      <description>These are my notes while trying to diagnose and better understnad some issues and oddities with the SharePoint 2010 User Profile Service Application.
If you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to populate pictures into people&amp;rsquo;s profiles, you&amp;rsquo;ll be using the Update-SPProfilePhotoStore powershell cmdlet after a normal sync (full or incremental - or your custom built one). This cmdlet is in theÂ Microsoft.Office.Server.UserProfiles dll, specifically the Microsoft.Office.Server.UserProfiles.PowerShell.SPCmdletUserProfilePhotoStore class. Thanks to the goodness that is Redgate Reflector(a must have for any SP developer), we can get a more clear undertanding of what the cmdlet is doing.</description>

      <description>Developing a CustomAction for the Ribbon and SharePoint 2010? If you&amp;rsquo;re like me - you follow some instructions online, deploy it once to verify it works, then change as needed and redeploy. One catch though - the data needed for the ribbon custom action to work is fetched by the browser and CACHED! So you won&amp;rsquo;t see your changes&amp;hellip;until you clear your cache. Stupid but true. You&amp;rsquo;re welcome.</description>

      <description>What else do you need?
Custom User Profile Properties (and several of the Out of Box ones) depend on a Managed Metadata Service Application being setup and associated with the application you&amp;rsquo;re working with. This is fairly trivial to setup. Just remember that after you set it up via the UI, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start it on the &amp;ldquo;Manage services on this server&amp;rdquo; page, and then perform an IIS reset. Forgetting these will keep your Managed Metadata service from working.</description>

      <description>In the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing SharePoint development, and SharePoint 2010 development in particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to blog about the snags or neat stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve come across. This post is for all those little pieces of knowledge that come from working with the platform that don&amp;rsquo;t seem large enough for their own post. If you find it useful, let me know in the comments.</description>

      <description>|- and so on with the error message. Do these also fit your situation? 1) The error happens when running a console application 2) Using PowerShell works to access the SPSite, SPWeb, or SPWebApplication that you&amp;rsquo;re accessing in your console application How do you fix this? Change your build platform target to x64 instead of x86. Also keep in mind that this is a per build configuration setting (so you have the setting for Debug and Release compile modes).</description>

      <description>This can be useful when you need a file to be right off the root of your Internet facing site - files like robots.txt, sitemap.xml, or the verification file for Google Webmaster tools. We&amp;rsquo;ll take advantage of PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s ability to use any .NET methods along with the Files collection on each SPWeb in SharePoint. $fileBytes = [system.io.file]::ReadAllBytes(&amp;quot;c:\the\full\path\to\your\file.txt&amp;quot;); $site = Get-SPSite &amp;quot;http://yourdomain:portifneeded&amp;quot;; $site.RootWeb.Files.Add(&amp;quot;file.txt&amp;quot;, $fileBytes, $true); This will result in a file.txt located at &amp;ldquo;http://yourdomain:portifneeded/file.</description>

      <description>SharePoint 2007 came with a page (storman.aspx) dedicated to showing you how much space each of the lists in your site collection were taking up. SharePoint 2010 removed this page. Luckily, SharePoint 2010 SP1 added it back in. But what if you&amp;rsquo;re still haven&amp;rsquo;t updated to SP1 and you&amp;rsquo;re getting warnings/errors about running out of space?
Obviously - up the space so as to avoid additional noise from your users. Then - figure out which libraries are taking up the most space.</description>

      <description>This idea comes from Kirk Hofer&amp;rsquo;s blog, but modfied to use the SharePoint 2010 powershell commandlets and not care about specifying credentials in the script. I figured most people would just keep using the credentials specified in their scheduled task. The script loads the SharePoint plugin, enumerates the zones, and sends a request to each one.
Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell; function Get-WebPage([string]$url) { $wc = new-object net.webclient; $wc.credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials; $pageContents = $wc.</description>

      <description>Since the MSDN documentation for Default Custom Action Loacations and IDs is unreliable (they look to have copy+pasted the information from the SharePoint 2007 documentation), our only sure bet is to browse the file system and find the custom action IDs and groups ourselves.
I had need of this information today, and found the items from the site settings page located at:
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\TEMPLATE\FEATURES\SiteSettings\SiteSettings.xml
For those looking specifically for it, here is the custom action for &amp;ldquo;Delete this site&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>In migrating some WebParts from SP2007 to SP2010, I came across a webpart that implements ICallbackEventHandler. This webpart was working fine when placed on the page, but did not work correctly in the webpart gallery. The specific error message being received was:
  The target &amp;lsquo;ctl00$PlaceHolderMain$ctl00&amp;rsquo;Â for the callback could not be found or did not implement ICallbackEventHandler
  This error is due to the webpart being added to the preview page dynamically at runtime.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to see exactly what your CQW is receiving. Put this into a style and see what properties and data you&amp;rsquo;re receiving:
&amp;lt;xsl:for-each select=&amp;#34;@*&amp;#34;&amp;gt; P:&amp;lt;xsl:value-of select=&amp;#34;name()&amp;#34; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; V:&amp;lt;xsl:value-of select=&amp;#34;.&amp;#34; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:for-each&amp;gt; </description>

      <description>I ran smack into an issue that was looking to be a serious problem yesterday. One of my development projects (SharePoint) is an anonymous access public-facing website. This site using built-in SharePoint web services and the download.aspx page in the \_layouts directory to facilitate lookup of related documents and provide download capability. The issue? Anonymous users can&amp;rsquo;t use any of the application pages in the \_layouts folder.
Lots of head scratching and some creative Google searches led me to the &amp;ldquo;DotNetIdeas&amp;rdquo; blog, specifically this post.</description>

      <description>Wrote a new field control today (SharePoint) that queried a specific list in another site collection based on the value of a field from the current list item. This worked great each time I&amp;rsquo;d test it out and add some additional functionality. When I finished the control, I did a little harder testing by hitting the refresh button in my browser over and over again. Randomly, my control wouldn&amp;rsquo;t render. Other times it would be fine.</description>

      <description>Trying to delete a field in a SharePoint library and get the message &amp;ldquo;Cannot complete this action. Pleast try again.&amp;rdquo;? This drove me nuts, as even invoking the delete method via the object model gives this message. What I found to allow a delete was pushing down changes via the content type gallery in the site collection (if the field was ever a part of that content type). This can be found by going to the following:</description>

      <description>I got this from a friend and have found it very useful for debugging my XSLT from content query web parts and data view web parts in Visual Studio. The below XSLT will output the source XML given to it:
&amp;lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; xmlns:xsl=&amp;#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&amp;#34; xmlns:msxsl=&amp;#34;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt&amp;#34; exclude-result-prefixes=&amp;#34;msxsl&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:output method=&amp;#34;xml&amp;#34; indent=&amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:template match=&amp;#34;@ node()&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:copy&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&amp;#34;@ node()&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:copy&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:template&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:stylesheet&amp;gt; </description>

      <title>IE8 Standards Mode and MOSS</title>

      <description>Using IE8 Standards Mode with MOSS has been fairly trouble-free so far. However, the richhtmlfield editor throws javascript errors when the page is in IE8 Standards mode. Without switching to the Telerik control or defaulting all of my pages to IE7 mode - there is a simpler fix!
Enable IE7 compatability mode only on your edit pages. My master page had the IE8 meta tag:
&amp;lt;meta equiv=&amp;#34;X-UA-Compatible&amp;#34; content=&amp;#34;IE=8&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; right under the head element.</description>
