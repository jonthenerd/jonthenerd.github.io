      <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing an upgrade of another site&amp;rsquo;s CMS Made Simple to version 1.11.11,
I found that in certain areas I was seeing warning messages at the top of the
screen after editing calendar events within CGCalendar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently updated a site I maintain that uses the great
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;CMS Made Simple&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; and had to
reconfigure SSL (https) for the administrative areas of the site. I&amp;rsquo;ve done this

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with Linux more often lately and have found several blogs out there to be very helpful. I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon some pretty good information and hope to post it here when I stumble upon it from time to time.
Initially I considered paying for hosting on my own blog - just to learn the ins and outs of Wordpress or CMS Made Simple. But the truth of the matter is - I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in tinkering with the technology than coming up with sample content.</description>
