            <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve
been a gamer ever since I first laid eyes on an Atari. But of all the genres
that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed - the Adventure Genre stands out the most. What games are
included on this list? Pretty much all Lucas Arts games&hellip;Monkey Island (1-4),
Loom, Day of the Tentacle, etc. Because of my age, these games (for the most
part) came out before I was old enough to realize that I needed to go buy them.
As such, I acquired them from garage sales and relatives wanting to get rid of
them. The adventure genre isn&rsquo;t known for its replayability, graphics, or
downright fun. What I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed was the tongue in cheek humor provided
by them. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the zany puzzles. I enjoyed the
&ldquo;talkies&rdquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->These kind of games have been abandoned as a viable genre.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Monkey Island
4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the last great (if you can call it great - it used the keyboard more
than the mouse) adventure game released by Lucas Arts&hellip;.all the way back in the
year 2000. So for seven years the world has needed a fresh adventure game. Who
stepped up to the plate? Telltale Games. Building on the success of Lucas Arts'
old Sam &amp; Max adventure game, Telltale Games built and released episodic Sam
&amp; Max adventure games through GameTap (a monthly PC game subscription
service). A friend of mine lets me use his secondary account, and I&rsquo;ve been
gladly enjoying Sam &amp; Max for the last six months. They&rsquo;ve completed the &ldquo;first
season&rdquo; of the game (6 games) and are now offering it for sale at their online
store. To be honest, Sam &amp; Max is the ONLY PC game I&rsquo;ve been playing in the
last six months. None of the rest have held my attention (or been as
entertaining).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s a brief rundown on how I&rsquo;d score this game if I
was reviewing for an online game site:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Graphics: 5/10 - The game
doesn&rsquo;t push my GPU hard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at all<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.
However, it&rsquo;s a cartoony looking game with 3D graphics and nicely modeled
characters. If it got much more graphically intensive, it wouldn&rsquo;t have the
comic feel that it should. You should be able to run this game on just about any
PC you could have bought in the last 4-5 years.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Replayability: 4/10 -
Once again - this isn&rsquo;t what adventure games are about. You may replay the game
once every few years. I tend to explore every aspect of an adventure game the
first time through, so replaying is done more for nostalgia sake than anything
else.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sound: 10/10 - the voice acting and ambient music are excellent
and really contribute to the feel of the game. The Sam &amp; Max voice actors remind
me of the old cartoon that was being produced years ago. So yes&hellip;this is a
&ldquo;talkie&rdquo; :)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Humor: 8/10 - The humor in this one (and most adventure
games) is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dry. My humor is the
same, so I found the games to be pretty funny. At times, the jokes and dialogue
just didn&rsquo;t tickle my funny bone - but they made my wife laugh. Good
stuff.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Challenge: 7.5/10 - This is one area where I was a bit
disappointed. The old Lucas Arts adventure games many times had you combining
different items in your inventory to do things (sometimes multiple items). These
games didn&rsquo;t do that at all. To top it off, each game generally had a similar
premise - Find out problem, get tool from the inconvenience store, solve
problem. Not that this was a totally bad thing - but a little more interactivity
with the items in the inventory would have been appreciated. At other times, the
puzzle completely stumped me and I ended up cheating (yeah I know&hellip;don&rsquo;t say
it). I didn&rsquo;t ever get that same feeling that I got when playing the first
couple Monkey Island games when I&rsquo;d solve some rediculous puzzle using multiple
combined items and timing my mouse clicks right. The game was still rewarding
though.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Worthy of purchase: 11/10. If you&rsquo;ve ever enjoyed adventure
games, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up and play through it (all 6
episodes). I&rsquo;m not advertising for TellTale here - but I think they&rsquo;ve done the
Sam &amp; Max franchise justice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you&rsquo;re interested in purchasing the
entire series, the
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->TellTale store<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has
it. You might also think about getting a 3 month subscription (or longer) to
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->GameTap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a pretty neat service
and has alot of good games to pick from besides the Sam &amp; Max Series.</p>
