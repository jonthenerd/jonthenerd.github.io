<p>I decided that in order to tinker without disrupting the smooth operation of my
workhorse PC, I ought to just build a testing box. In the event that I can
actually tinker enough to stop wanting to tinker (like that&rsquo;s going to happen),
I also wanted the PC to serve a dual role as an eventual Media Center PC
(Windows or otherwise). So I laid out some requirements:Multiple
Core - I&rsquo;ve read that the latest versions of software that play High-Def video
(DVD & Blu-Ray) recommend having dual core. No reason to skimp on this as many
inexpensive CPUs have this nowOnboard DVI - While I may eventually get
a better video card for this system, having the ability to otuput to my HDTV
using a
DVI->HDMI
converter will come in really handy.Small Case - I&rsquo;ve owned plenty of
too-huge computers. This should be able to blend into my entertainment
setupMaximum Linux compatibility - If I&rsquo;m going to be running
Linux
and don&rsquo;t want headaches&mldr;Linux needs to be able to recognize my hardware
pretty much out of the box. Not that I can&rsquo;t install drivers/whatnot - but the
most promising thing when putting together a machine and installing the OS is
actually seeing that none of your hardware is DOA.With these goals, I
set out to find the parts I wanted. I&rsquo;ve had mostly good experiences at
Newegg,
and chose to use them again. After several hours of comparison shopping and
checking the
Internet
for Linux compatibility - I came up with this setup:Case:
Apevia
X-QPack
linkMotherboard:
ASUS
M2NBP-VM
CSM
linkProcessor:
AMD
Athlon
X2 3800 (Socket AM2)
linkRam:
Kingston
DDR2
533 1GB
linkHard
Drive:
WD
320GB
SATA
linkDVD
Burner: LG 18X
linkAt
the time I purchased the parts - the Intel Core 2 Duos were definitely
outperforming their
AMD
counterparts. However, the
Athlon
X2 3800 was cheaper than any Core 2 Duo. I&rsquo;ve also had good experiences with
Nvidia
chipsets
& Linux - so what the hey. I got the ASUS motherboard primarily because of
my excellent experience with prior ASUS mobos. It&rsquo;s also nice that it has
onboard DVI.Everything arrived quickly and nothing was DOA. I did
experience some minor sound issues with different
Linux
distros
and Windows - but not enough to call the motherboard defective or anything.
Probably more of a driver issue. If you are using this motherboard under
windows - I would suggest uninstalling the Nvidia firewall which is installed
when you use the unified driver on the ASUS CD. Find another firewall&mldr; Never
really liked the Nvidia one.I&rsquo;ll detail my Linux installation
fun
(fun is also code for excrutiating
frustration in some cases) in a future article. Thanks for the read!</p>
