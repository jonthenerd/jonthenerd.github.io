            <p>I decided that in order to tinker without disrupting the smooth operation of my
workhorse PC, I ought to just build a testing box. In the event that I can
actually tinker enough to stop wanting to tinker (like that&rsquo;s going to happen),
I also wanted the PC to serve a dual role as an eventual Media Center PC
(Windows or otherwise). So I laid out some requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Core - I&rsquo;ve read that the latest versions of software that play High-Def video
(DVD &amp; Blu-Ray) recommend having dual core. No reason to skimp on this as many
inexpensive CPUs have this now</li>
<li>Onboard DVI - While I may eventually get a better video card for this system, having the ability to otuput to my HDTV
using a DVI-&gt;HDMI converter will come in really handy.</li>
<li>Small Case - I&rsquo;ve owned plenty of too-huge computers. This should be able to blend into my entertainment
setup</li>
<li>Maximum Linux compatibility - If I&rsquo;m going to be running Linux
and don&rsquo;t want headaches&hellip;Linux needs to be able to recognize my hardware
pretty much out of the box. Not that I can&rsquo;t install drivers/whatnot - but the
most promising thing when putting together a machine and installing the OS is
actually seeing that none of your hardware is DOA.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these goals, I set out to find the parts I wanted. I&rsquo;ve had mostly good experiences at
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/">Newegg</a>, and chose to use them again. After several hours of comparison shopping and
checking the Internet for Linux compatibility - I came up with this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: Apevia X-QPack</li>
<li>Motherboard: ASU M2 NBP-VM CSM</li>
<li>Processor: AMD Athlon X2 3800 (Socket AM2)</li>
<li>Ram: Kingston DDR2 533 1GB</li>
<li>Hard Drive: WD 320GB SATA</li>
<li>DVD Burner: LG 18X</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time I purchased the parts - the Intel Core 2 Duos were definitely outperforming their AMD
counterparts. However, the Athlon X2 3800 was cheaper than any Core 2 Duo. I&rsquo;ve also had good experiences with
Nvidia chipsets &amp; Linux - so what the hey. I got the ASUS motherboard primarily because of
my excellent experience with prior ASUS mobos. It&rsquo;s also nice that it has onboard DVI.</p>
<p>Everything arrived quickly and nothing was DOA. I did experience some minor sound issues with different
Linux distros and Windows - but not enough to call the motherboard defective or anything.
Probably more of a driver issue. If you are using this motherboard under
windows - I would suggest uninstalling the Nvidia firewall which is installed
when you use the unified driver on the ASUS CD. Find another firewall&hellip; Never
really liked the Nvidia one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll detail my Linux installation <em>fun</em> (fun is also code for excrutiating
frustration in some cases) in a future article. Thanks for the read!</p>
