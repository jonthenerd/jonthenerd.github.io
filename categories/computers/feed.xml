      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just about finished backing everything up off of my main machine (Windows 7 32-bit Ultimate). I&amp;rsquo;ve heard alot of good things about Windows 7 (read quite a bit too) - and even decent things about the install process. What&amp;rsquo;s tying me to Windows is Fallout 3 and the random Windows-only game&amp;hellip;sorry Ubuntu, I love ya&#39; but we just can&amp;rsquo;t go steady yet.I&amp;rsquo;ll update this post as I install and use this new OS.</description>

      <description>? Minutes ago, I started to use my Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 (v2.0)&amp;hellip;and the pointer was jumpy&amp;hellip;kinda jittery&amp;hellip;whenever I moved it left to right. Up and down was fine though. I resynced the mouse, replace the batteries, and even restarted&amp;hellip;still it was jumpy. I&amp;rsquo;ve long since lost the receipt to this mouse (which I really like&amp;hellip;would hate to replace it) - so did some searching for others who may have had this issue.</description>

      <description>I was fortunate to get a new laptop at work recently. I took my time on a long weekend configuring it to my satisfaction, but was annoyed by an annoying &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; noise coming from the speakers after every sound. A little further testing showed that this was only when the machine was on battery power. This poston notebookreview and this poston the OpenSuse forums point to incorrect power management settings for the sound hardware.</description>

      <description>I managed to purchase one of these little gems in late April. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a longtime fan of Linux and Asus in general, so the thought of a little laptop running the free OS was enough to keep me dreaming until I broke down and ordered one. I bought a 7&amp;quot; model with the4 gig hard drive and an extra 2 gigs of ram. I did the ram install myself and setup the Advanced Desktop to my liking.</description>

      <title>Laptop BIOS/CMOS reset = pain</title>

      <description>This post is for those individuals looking to see if this is possible&amp;hellip; I just reset the BIOS on an HP Pavilion ZE4900 (laptop) by removing and replacing the CMOS battery. The online manual doesn&amp;rsquo;t show its location - but you need to complete disassemble the laptop down to removing the main board. The CMOS battery is located on the underside of the board toward the front of the laptop. Needless to say - the last four hours are hours I&amp;rsquo;ll never get back :-/</description>

      <description>I decided that in order to tinker without disrupting the smooth operation of my workhorse PC, I ought to just build a testing box. In the event that I can actually tinker enough to stop wanting to tinker (like that&amp;rsquo;s going to happen), I also wanted the PC to serve a dual role as an eventual Media Center PC (Windows or otherwise). So I laid out some requirements:Multiple Core - I&amp;rsquo;ve read that the latest versions of software that play High-Def video (DVD &amp;amp; Blu-Ray) recommend having dual core.</description>
