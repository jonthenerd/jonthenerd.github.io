Custom User Profile Properties (and several of the Out of Box ones) depend on a Managed Metadata Service Application being setup and associated with the application you&amp;rsquo;re working with. This is fairly trivial to setup. Just remember that after you set it up via the UI, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start it on the &amp;ldquo;Manage services on this server&amp;rdquo; page, and then perform an IIS reset. Forgetting these will keep your Managed Metadata service from working.</description></item><item><title>Jon's General SharePoint 2010 Development Tips</title><link>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2011/10/18/jons-general-sharepoint-2010-development-tips/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2011/10/18/jons-general-sharepoint-2010-development-tips/</guid><description>In the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing SharePoint development, and SharePoint 2010 development in particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to blog about the snags or neat stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve come across.

One of my development projects (SharePoint) is an anonymous access public-facing website. This site using built-in SharePoint web services and the download.aspx page in the _layouts directory to facilitate lookup of related documents and provide download capability. The issue? Anonymous users can&amp;rsquo;t use any of the application pages in the _layouts folder. Lots of head scratching and some creative Google searches led me to the &amp;ldquo;DotNetIdeas&amp;rdquo; blog, specifically this post.</description></item><item><title>Fastest XML Editor/Viewer</title><link>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2010/03/10/fastest-xml-editorviewer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2010/03/10/fastest-xml-editorviewer/</guid><description>I use Visual Studio every day for just about all of my development tasks. However, I attempted to open a large xml file (&amp;gt; 20 megs) and Visual studio spiked up to 1.5 gigs of memory consumption and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything&amp;hellip; My old standby notepad++ (great editor!) also hung on opening the file. A quick search yielded First Object&amp;rsquo;s XML Editor. Worked great. Super fast.</description></item><item><title>XSLT that emits source XML</title><link>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2010/01/27/xslt-that-emits-source-xml/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2010/01/27/xslt-that-emits-source-xml/</guid><description>? I got this from a friend and have found it very useful for debugging my XSLT from content query web parts and data view web parts in Visual Studio.

Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of C/C++&amp;hellip; This isn&amp;rsquo;t a language I wish to make a language coding. In fact - many parts of my C/C++ education were /very/ lacking. However, there are times when I think back to things that I could have done better, things I really enjoyed coding (Blackjack console app with ASCII cards..heh), and things I just plain didn&amp;rsquo;t understand or care to.</description></item><item><title>Active Directory homeDrive (Home Folder)</title><link>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2008/06/19/active-directory-homedrive-home-folder/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2008/06/19/active-directory-homedrive-home-folder/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re using an automated tool to create your user accounts and assign a Home Folder (a mapped drive pointing to shared location on a server) - make certain that the property has a colon after the drive letter (e.g. Z:not Z). Without the colon, the drive will not be mapped on user log on. How do you know if this property is set correctly? Active Directory Users and Computers won&amp;rsquo;t show you.</description></item><item><title>Finding the last login date for all profiles</title><link>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2008/06/12/finding-the-last-login-date-for-all-profiles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2008/06/12/finding-the-last-login-date-for-all-profiles/</guid><description>By day I am but an humble IT worker - currently tasked with maintaining and improving scripts and tools that keep our enterprise workstations humming. My largest project thus far has been an ever growing inventory script (now a .NET 2 app) that reports information back to a SQL database. This app is run on a schedule by a service I wrote. The script collects great pieces of information - everything from the screen resolution being used to information on SQL Server instances on the device (yep - inventories servers too!</description></item></channel></rss>
