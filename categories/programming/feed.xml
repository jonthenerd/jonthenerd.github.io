      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next in this series on the SharePoint Framework are extensions.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/extensions/overview-extensions&#34;&gt;According to docs.microsoft.com, SPFx Extensions allow for the customization of multiple facets of the SharePoint experience&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on differences I made while following the online tutorial and my
observations on capabilities and impacts of SPFx Application Customizer
extensions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you have multiple projects and one or more of them have dependencies (or
just plain don&amp;rsquo;t work) on certain versions of node? What to do?
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/creationix/nvm&#34;&gt;Node Version Manager (NVM) allows you to install and switch between them &amp;ldquo;with ease&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
(quotes added as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post as I get it installed for the first
time myself&amp;hellip; lets see just how easy it is!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>These are my notes while trying to diagnose and better understnad some issues and oddities with the SharePoint 2010 User Profile Service Application.
If you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to populate pictures into people&amp;rsquo;s profiles, you&amp;rsquo;ll be using the Update-SPProfilePhotoStore powershell cmdlet after a normal sync (full or incremental - or your custom built one). This cmdlet is in theÂ Microsoft.Office.Server.UserProfiles dll, specifically the Microsoft.Office.Server.UserProfiles.PowerShell.SPCmdletUserProfilePhotoStore class. Thanks to the goodness that is Redgate Reflector(a must have for any SP developer), we can get a more clear undertanding of what the cmdlet is doing.</description>

      <description>Developing a CustomAction for the Ribbon and SharePoint 2010? If you&amp;rsquo;re like me - you follow some instructions online, deploy it once to verify it works, then change as needed and redeploy. One catch though - the data needed for the ribbon custom action to work is fetched by the browser and CACHED! So you won&amp;rsquo;t see your changes&amp;hellip;until you clear your cache. Stupid but true. You&amp;rsquo;re welcome.</description>

      <description>What else do you need?
Custom User Profile Properties (and several of the Out of Box ones) depend on a Managed Metadata Service Application being setup and associated with the application you&amp;rsquo;re working with. This is fairly trivial to setup. Just remember that after you set it up via the UI, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start it on the &amp;ldquo;Manage services on this server&amp;rdquo; page, and then perform an IIS reset. Forgetting these will keep your Managed Metadata service from working.</description>

      <description>In the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing SharePoint development, and SharePoint 2010 development in particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to blog about the snags or neat stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve come across. This post is for all those little pieces of knowledge that come from working with the platform that don&amp;rsquo;t seem large enough for their own post. If you find it useful, let me know in the comments.</description>

      <description>|- and so on with the error message. Do these also fit your situation? 1) The error happens when running a console application 2) Using PowerShell works to access the SPSite, SPWeb, or SPWebApplication that you&amp;rsquo;re accessing in your console application How do you fix this? Change your build platform target to x64 instead of x86. Also keep in mind that this is a per build configuration setting (so you have the setting for Debug and Release compile modes).</description>

      <description>This can be useful when you need a file to be right off the root of your Internet facing site - files like robots.txt, sitemap.xml, or the verification file for Google Webmaster tools. We&amp;rsquo;ll take advantage of PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s ability to use any .NET methods along with the Files collection on each SPWeb in SharePoint. $fileBytes = [system.io.file]::ReadAllBytes(&amp;quot;c:\the\full\path\to\your\file.txt&amp;quot;); $site = Get-SPSite &amp;quot;http://yourdomain:portifneeded&amp;quot;; $site.RootWeb.Files.Add(&amp;quot;file.txt&amp;quot;, $fileBytes, $true); This will result in a file.txt located at &amp;ldquo;http://yourdomain:portifneeded/file.</description>

      <description>SharePoint 2007 came with a page (storman.aspx) dedicated to showing you how much space each of the lists in your site collection were taking up. SharePoint 2010 removed this page. Luckily, SharePoint 2010 SP1 added it back in. But what if you&amp;rsquo;re still haven&amp;rsquo;t updated to SP1 and you&amp;rsquo;re getting warnings/errors about running out of space?
Obviously - up the space so as to avoid additional noise from your users. Then - figure out which libraries are taking up the most space.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t see any reason to still make the extension available, maintain it, etc. if you can get the same or better experience straight from Google Calendar.</description>

I had need of this information today, and found the items from the site settings page located at:
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\TEMPLATE\FEATURES\SiteSettings\SiteSettings.xml

  The target &amp;lsquo;ctl00$PlaceHolderMain$ctl00&amp;rsquo;Â for the callback could not be found or did not implement ICallbackEventHandler
  This error is due to the webpart being added to the preview page dynamically at runtime.</description>

      <description>I ran smack into an issue that was looking to be a serious problem yesterday. One of my development projects (SharePoint) is an anonymous access public-facing website. This site using built-in SharePoint web services and the download.aspx page in the \_layouts directory to facilitate lookup of related documents and provide download capability. The issue? Anonymous users can&amp;rsquo;t use any of the application pages in the \_layouts folder.
Lots of head scratching and some creative Google searches led me to the &amp;ldquo;DotNetIdeas&amp;rdquo; blog, specifically this post.</description>

      <description>I use Visual Studio every day for just about all of my development tasks. However, I attempted to open a large xml file (&amp;gt; 20 megs) and Visual studio spiked up to 1.5 gigs of memory consumption and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything&amp;hellip; My old standby notepad++ (great editor!) also hung on opening the file. A quick search yielded First Object&amp;rsquo;s XML Editor. Worked great. Super fast.</description>

      <description>Wrote a new field control today (SharePoint) that queried a specific list in another site collection based on the value of a field from the current list item. This worked great each time I&amp;rsquo;d test it out and add some additional functionality. When I finished the control, I did a little harder testing by hitting the refresh button in my browser over and over again. Randomly, my control wouldn&amp;rsquo;t render. Other times it would be fine.</description>

      <description>I got this from a friend and have found it very useful for debugging my XSLT from content query web parts and data view web parts in Visual Studio. The below XSLT will output the source XML given to it:
&amp;lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; xmlns:xsl=&amp;#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&amp;#34; xmlns:msxsl=&amp;#34;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt&amp;#34; exclude-result-prefixes=&amp;#34;msxsl&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:output method=&amp;#34;xml&amp;#34; indent=&amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:template match=&amp;#34;@ node()&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:copy&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&amp;#34;@ node()&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:copy&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:template&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:stylesheet&amp;gt; </description>

      <description>I ran across this the other day and found it funny. A google search reveals that it may be from a mailing list from around 2000.
If clients treated architects like they treat software designersâ¦
Dear Mr. Architect,
Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of what I need, so you should use your discretion. My house should have somewhere between two and forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms can be easily added or deleted.</description>

      <title>IE8 Standards Mode and MOSS</title>

      <description>Using IE8 Standards Mode with MOSS has been fairly trouble-free so far. However, the richhtmlfield editor throws javascript errors when the page is in IE8 Standards mode. Without switching to the Telerik control or defaulting all of my pages to IE7 mode - there is a simpler fix!
Enable IE7 compatability mode only on your edit pages. My master page had the IE8 meta tag:
&amp;lt;meta equiv=&amp;#34;X-UA-Compatible&amp;#34; content=&amp;#34;IE=8&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; right under the head element.</description>

      <description>Every once in a while I&amp;rsquo;ll start thinking of long-past written code. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of C/C++&amp;hellip; This isn&amp;rsquo;t a language I wish to make a living coding. In fact - many parts of my C/C++ education were /very/ lacking. However, there are times when I think back to things that I could have done better, things I really enjoyed coding (Blackjack console app with ASCII cards..heh), and things I just plain didn&amp;rsquo;t understand or care to.</description>

      <description>By day I am but an humble IT worker - currently tasked with maintaining and improving scripts and tools that keep our enterprise workstations humming. My largest project thus far has been an ever growing inventory script (now a .NET 2 app) that reports information back to a SQL database. This app is run on a schedule by a service I wrote. The script collects great pieces of information - everything from the screen resolution being used to information on SQL Server instances on the device (yep - inventories servers too!</description>
