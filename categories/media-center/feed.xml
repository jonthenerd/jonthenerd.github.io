Several times in the past few years (since 2002 actually), I&amp;rsquo;d get the &amp;ldquo;Linux Bug&amp;rdquo; and repartition my hard drive to be able to try out some new distro. This would normally come about after I&amp;rsquo;d read some positive review of said distro (or from a friend). What have I tried in the past? I started out on Mandrake (now Mandriva), moved to SUSE 8 &amp;amp; 9, then MEPIS (great distro btw), and now Ubuntu.</description></item><item><title>The little Linux Box that could</title><link>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2007/01/26/the-little-linux-box-that-could/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.jonthenerd.com/2007/01/26/the-little-linux-box-that-could/</guid><description>I decided that in order to tinker without disrupting the smooth operation of my workhorse PC, I ought to just build a testing box. In the event that I can actually tinker enough to stop wanting to tinker (like that&amp;rsquo;s going to happen), I also wanted the PC to serve a dual role as an eventual Media Center PC (Windows or otherwise). So I laid out some requirements:Multiple Core - I&amp;rsquo;ve read that the latest versions of software that play High-Def video (DVD &amp;amp; Blu-Ray) recommend having dual core.</description></item></channel></rss>
