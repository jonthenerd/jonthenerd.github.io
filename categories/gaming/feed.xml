      <description>The new Sonic 4 is a bit of a novelty. This though - this is what Sonic fans have been waiting for:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m putting together a server for some friends to play Unreal Tournament (yes, the original). I had heard this was doable on Linux, and I have a friend&amp;rsquo;s old laptop here to play with. I&amp;rsquo;ll be putting good links here that have helped me to get this working.
I got it all setup in a VirtualBox VM, but need it on the separate machine. This old laptop has a broken screen and no hard drive&amp;hellip;no problem!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a gamer ever since I first laid eyes on an Atari. But of all the genres that I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed - the Adventure Genre stands out the most. What games are included on this list? Pretty much all Lucas Arts games&amp;hellip;Monkey Island (1-4), Loom, Day of the Tentacle, etc. Because of my age, these games (for the most part) came out before I was old enough to realize that I needed to go buy them.</description>
