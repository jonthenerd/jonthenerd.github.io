      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m putting together a server for some friends to play Unreal Tournament (yes, the original). I had heard this was doable on Linux, and I have a friend&amp;rsquo;s old laptop here to play with. I&amp;rsquo;ll be putting good links here that have helped me to get this working.I got it all setup in a VirtualBox VM, but need it on the separate machine. This old laptop has a broken screen and no hard drive&amp;hellip;no problem!</description>

      <description>Thus far in using Ubuntu, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to use only Linux applications. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that some of them were just ports of their Windows or Mac OS X counterparts&amp;hellip;but I never had to install wine (a compatibility layer for running Windows programs). Well you know that torrent app I recommended? kTorrent? It&amp;rsquo;s crashed on me several times in the last couple days&amp;hellip;and ate up every bit of memory the system had this morning.</description>

      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve tried Ubuntu (or Linux for that matter). Several times in the past few years (since 2002 actually), I&amp;rsquo;d get the &amp;ldquo;Linux Bug&amp;rdquo; and repartition my hard drive to be able to try out some new distro. This would normally come about after I&amp;rsquo;d read some positive review of said distro (or from a friend). What have I tried in the past? I started out on Mandrake (now Mandriva), moved to SUSE 8 &amp;amp; 9, then MEPIS (great distro btw), and now Ubuntu.</description>
