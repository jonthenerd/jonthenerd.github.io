      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a previous post, I wrote about how I moved this blog to Hugo. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been receiving notifications from GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Dependabot about dependencies needing to be addressed&amp;hellip; in the &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt;. These are two files that don&amp;rsquo;t exist in the repo or any branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got tired of the emails and large yellow banner at the top of the repo. Time to hunt for a fix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I decided to rebuild my blog atop Hugo, the &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites.&amp;rdquo; I did this for a few reasons:
GitHub has been diligent in reminding me that there are security vulnerabilities in the dependencies of my blog. I used jekyll for the static site building, a collection of npm packages for some glue-code in the build process, and based my theme on twitter bootstrap. All of this adds up to a lot of dependencies to keep up with, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been blogging for a while&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with Linux more often lately and have found several blogs out there to be very helpful. I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon some pretty good information and hope to post it here when I stumble upon it from time to time.
Initially I considered paying for hosting on my own blog - just to learn the ins and outs of Wordpress or CMS Made Simple. But the truth of the matter is - I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in tinkering with the technology than coming up with sample content.</description>
