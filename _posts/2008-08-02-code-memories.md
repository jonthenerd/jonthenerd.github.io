Every once in a while I'll start thinking of long-past written code.  Lately I've been thinking of C/C++...  This isn't a language I wish to make a language coding.  In fact - many parts of my C/C++ education were /very/ lacking.  However, there are times when I think back to things that I could have done better, things I really enjoyed coding (Blackjack console app with ASCII cards..heh), and things I just plain didn't understand or care to.<br /><br />Quick Google search brought up <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a> for relearning some of that forgotten knowledge.  I make a quick run through and got as far as classes before taking a breather- which means I learned more syntax in an hour than in my entire High School programming courses (and almost as much as 2 semesters of Computer Science....ug).<br /><br />Amazing what our brains will bring back up when we least expect it. :-/
