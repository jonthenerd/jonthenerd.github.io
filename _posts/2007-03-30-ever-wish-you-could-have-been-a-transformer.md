If you were ever a fan of the series - you owe it to yourself to check out their awesome costumes!<br /><br />Here's the Transformers Movie Trailer --><br /><br /><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zZp75fWe-ss"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zZp75fWe-ss" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object>
