I heard this on the radio the other day and it felt like President Reagan was in the here and now - speaking to the heart of what is planned for our country by the current lot of politicians in office (both sides of the fence...if the fence still exists at all). I grew up hearing of Reagan but wasn't old enough to care or pay attention - speeches like this are going to have me listening to old recordings for a while to come.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fRdLpem-AAs&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fRdLpem-AAs&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
