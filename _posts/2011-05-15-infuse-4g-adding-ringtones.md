This is old information to those who've had an Android for a while, but it was news to me... To add mp3 ringtones, use the usb cable supplied with the phone to mount the internal SD card (the 2 gig one). Then, create the following folder structure:

/media/audio/ringtones
/media/audio/notifications
/media/audio/alarms

Place your mp3 ringtones into the ringtones folder. Done.
