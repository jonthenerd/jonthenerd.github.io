I recieved an email today from Google AdSense indicating that I needed to review the privacy settings of my site(s) for which Google Ads are served (this one included). By default, they have enabled ads that use your browsing history to put you into user categories. I don't particularly like that idea - so I turned it off.  Same ol' Google Ads here!<br /><br /><blockquote>Do not show ads based on user interest categories. Visitation information from my sites will not be used to help create interest categories.</blockquote>
