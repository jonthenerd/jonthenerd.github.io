I decided to upgrade the navigation DVD in my car. Being who I am, this is a DIY project (once you get the DVD, of course).

 Followed the <a href="http://lexus.sewellparts.com/pdf/Navigation_System_Installation_Guide.pdf">instructions from Sewell Parts</a>, I hit a snag... what precision screwdrivers would fit?

I dug out my bag o' tools and found the smallest screwdrivers. Tried them. No dice.

A friend of mine has a 2007 LS 460 and I noticed he had these tools in his trunk in a special bag. Searching my car, I could find no such tools. I couldn't find much on the internet about this either. Where are the navigation DVD removal picks/screwdrivers in a Lexus IS 250/350?

They're in the tool bag that has the tire iron. It's somewhat L shaped, and mine was next to the spare tire. If you open the bag, the location of these tools is easy to overlook. Here's a picture of where they're at.
