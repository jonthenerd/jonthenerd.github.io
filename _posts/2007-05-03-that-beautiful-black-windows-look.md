Been a while since I've posted anything. Reason being, I haven't had much time for anything fun technology wise. A couple weeks ago, I upgraded my ancient Dell laptop's ram. This decent speedup allowed me to continue using it without cringing. As such - it was time to deck it out with the typical compliment of visual goodness.<br /><br />First thing - the Black Luna theme from Microsoft, known as Royale Noir. It's a black version of the Windows XP Media center theme.<br /><br /><p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5060425655812546146" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_D1O7K_QiCIk/Rjo-Upr63mI/AAAAAAAAABQ/HyQtUFzijV0/s320/royalenoir.gif" border="0" /></p><p>Intersted in obtaining this theme and installing it? Here's a <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20061029/royale-noir/">link</a>. I personally prefer this theme, and have been using it for just about a year now. It's definitely delayed my purchase of Vista. :)<br /></p>
