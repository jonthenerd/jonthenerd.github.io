I decided earlier in the semester to discontinue this graduate degree and go after something I had more fun with - specifically an IT career.  I haven't really gone into much detail here on what my skillset is (besides toying with Ubuntu...which really isn't a skill).  But my background is primarily that of an Information Systems graduate (with a high GPA) with some self-employed programming projects under my belt.  Looking for jobs online hasn't been exactly pleasant - or yielded results (yet).<br /><br />Here are a few places I've put my resume out to (and found jobs to apply to):<br /><a href="http://www.monster.com">www.monster.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com">www.careerbuilder.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.computerjobs.com">www.computerjobs.com</a><br /><br />These seem to be the front-runners in the market as far as job-boards go for IT people.  So why has my search been trying?  A couple reasons:<br /><ul><li>I have virtually ZERO experience being that I'm a college grad and haven't been in the industry.  Many jobs want at least "1+" or "2+" years of experience in an area I consider myself to be pretty good at - but don't qualify for because I haven't worked a job doing such.</li><li>I'm currently located in Northwest Arkansas...and am looking for a job in Houston, TX.  This shouldn't be a barrier - but to some it seems like it is.  </li></ul><p>Overall this post is a rant.  I know it - you know it.  Finding a place to "get your foot in the door" without being religated to the Help-Desk is difficult when looking online.  Searching for jobs with the text "Entry Level" yields little to nothing consistently.  Perhaps this is a market?  Shouldn't there be a place for the nation's top IT firms to recruit the nation's top IT grads and talent?  Many of us are willing and able to relocate.  I think I may be onto something here...</p>
