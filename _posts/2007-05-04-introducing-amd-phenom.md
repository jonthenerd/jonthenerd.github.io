Intel switched their flagship line to the "Core" nameplate.  AMD was bound to follow suit.  As this <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Final+AMD+Stars+Models+Unveiled+/article7157.htm?www.reghardware.co.uk">DailyTech article</a> points out, the Phenom is a member of the AMD Stars family of processors that also includes the new AMD Athlon 64 and Sempron 64.  You'll want to see the <a href="http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/4622_large_stars_list.png">PPT slide</a> for a breakdown of what exactly will be available.  Here are some highlights though:<br /><br /><ul><li>This new line of chips is AMD K10.  The original Athlon 64 was K8</li><li>All new chips except the absolute upper-end Phenom FX Quad Core will use Socket AM2+</li><li>Phenom X4 ( a quad core chip) has a TDP of only 89W!  MUCH better than AMD's previous consumer quad core product.</li></ul>Is this the start of a new competitive streak for AMD?  That would be a great thing, not only for AMD - but for anyone looking to buy a new processor.  With competition comes price drops and more value for your money :)  I'm thinking now's a time to invest a little money in AMD.
