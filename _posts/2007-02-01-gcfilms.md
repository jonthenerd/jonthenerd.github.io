I've been working to organize my movie collection on this Ubuntu computer.  I'm a big fan of nice GUIs, and found a pretty good one for organizing any film/TV collection.  It's called GCfilms.  It has an entry in the Ubuntu repository, so installing it is a cinch through Synaptic.   Here's a screenshot from their homepage:<br /><br /><a href="http://home.gna.org/gcfilms/">GCfilms Homepage</a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_D1O7K_QiCIk/RcJiqW6CawI/AAAAAAAAAAw/8ZHgbNcFIR8/s1600-h/screen1_en.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_D1O7K_QiCIk/RcJiqW6CawI/AAAAAAAAAAw/8ZHgbNcFIR8/s320/screen1_en.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5026688613941930754" border="0" /></a><br />GCfilms can even launch the video file you have linked from it in your favorite media player.  It is default set to mplayer, so if you're using a GNOME desktop like Ubuntu - you might want to change that to gmplayer.  Gmplayer is mplayer with a nicely done GUI, enabling you to change preferences of the video you're viewing on the fly.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_D1O7K_QiCIk/RcJl426CaxI/AAAAAAAAAA8/tiejU7sjdyM/s1600-h/Screenshot.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_D1O7K_QiCIk/RcJl426CaxI/AAAAAAAAAA8/tiejU7sjdyM/s200/Screenshot.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5026692161584917266" border="0" /></a>
