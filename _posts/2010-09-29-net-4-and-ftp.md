It comes <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.ftpwebrequest.aspx">baked in</a>. Yay!

Update:
Apparently seeing products that do FTP in .NET for years made me think this wasn't built in. It's been around since .NET 2.0... Another blogger has even <a href="http://www.dijksterhuis.org/webclient-class-upload-download-ftp-files/">created a helper class that encapsulates everything you want to do in .NET with FTP (and it works on mono!)</a>.
