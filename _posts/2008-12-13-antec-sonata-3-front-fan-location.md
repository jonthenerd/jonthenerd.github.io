I looked for this before when I was putting my new computer together and was unable to find where the optional front fan mounted...I was expecting between the metal inner case and the outside plastic. See pic for where it mounts:<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_D1O7K_QiCIk/SUPYPw_gR2I/AAAAAAAAATw/mh0uhNXehFA/s1600-h/Sonata+-+Fan+Location.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 293px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_D1O7K_QiCIk/SUPYPw_gR2I/AAAAAAAAATw/mh0uhNXehFA/s320/Sonata+-+Fan+Location.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5279300953569249122" border="0" /></a><br />So ya - it does have 120 mm fan mounts there.  Good to know.
