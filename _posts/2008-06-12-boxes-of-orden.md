I just finished reading Chainfire, by Terry Goodkind.  I had taken a 2 year hiatus from reading the series and finally returned to it.  If you're looking to pick up recreational reading, I highly recommend the series.  It starts with "Wizard's First Rule".  Truly one of the best series of our time.<br /><br />As this is my first post in a while - I've got some things to blog.  Maybe I can generate some traffic (or maybe a search bot or two...)  :-)
