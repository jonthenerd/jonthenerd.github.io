<span style="font-weight: bold;">Good News!</span><br />I've got some good news on the job hunting front.  After lots of applications and job-board searching, I've managed to secure an interview (yes one) at a company in Northwest Houston. I've also garnered a couple of phone interviews (mostly recruiters looking for <span style="font-style: italic;">more experience</span>...).  But this is progress! Considering how little time I've been hunting a job, a couple potential hires is a pretty good amount (I think).  What's most interesting to me is that my solid in-person job interview was acquired by word of mouth from a friend on a car forum. That just goes to show the depth of importance networking plays in finding a job!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interesting...</span><br />So what skills are IT companies looking for in the Houston area? In my searching, the most requested skills are as follows:<br /><ul><li>C#/ASP.net/VB.net/.net in general<br /></li><li>SAP</li><li>Oracle, SQL Server</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Doing a Background Check?</span><br />In the likely event that one of those companies ends up on this blog while doing a background check - welcome! You're one of only a few to have actually seen this corner of the WWW. :)
