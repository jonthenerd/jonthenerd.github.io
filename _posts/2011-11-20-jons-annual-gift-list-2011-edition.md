Some friends and family have had a hard time buying gifts for me, so I provide a list each year that might help :) As I come across things I could use or find neat, I'll update this post. Thanks!
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/MEPQ936AL2/" target="_blank">OWC Mercury Elite Pro RAID hard drive enclosure</a> - I've been using my 2010 Mac Mini as a server for backup and mythtv. I've got a hard drive I could add to it, but need an enclosure to hold it in. $95</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ronaldjenkees.com/cd-store/" target="_blank">Both of Ronald Jenkees' CDs from his website</a> - He'll personally sign them if you buy both at once! $24 for the set</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.starbucksstore.com/Chambord-Coffee-Press-by-Bodum%C2%AE-4-cup/001148549,default,pd.html?start=1&amp;cgid=coffee-presses">A chambered coffee press like this one from Starbucks</a> - The coffee at work isn't very good. With this, I could make my own! I'd just like a small french press, it doesn't need to be this fancy.Â $36.95</li>
	<li><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Donate">Donate to the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia</a> - I use Wikipedia all the time, and chances are that you do too. Donate to them and let me know you did and I'll think that's a gift :) $5+</li>
	<li>Cowboys vs Aliens on Blu-Ray - I wanted to see this in theaters but didn't get to. The Blu-Ray comes out on December 6th and can be found anywhere between Kroger to Wal-Mart to Best Buy. $30ish?</li>
</ul>
