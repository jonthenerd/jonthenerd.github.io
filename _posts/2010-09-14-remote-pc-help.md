Tonight I got a chance to use LogMeIn Rescue and found it a very nice experience for helping a family member with their PC. Knowing it was a trial - I checked the license price...thinking that those I help could fund the license if it was cheap enough ($50-$150?). Well - It's $1188 for a year subscription! This is really too bad for the helpful IT relative - unless you're running a business it's just not worth it. They should mark the price way down and limit you to say 4 connections a month or something...<div><br /></div><div>So - a little Googling for a cheaper alternative revealed <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/index.aspx">TeamViewer</a> - which is free for personal use and looks to be fairly full featured. I'll be using this next time somebody needs some PC help. </div>
