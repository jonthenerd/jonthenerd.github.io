Found this a little odd today. My wife's Infuse 4G didn't have me as a contact. In her Google Contacts, I was in a group - but not the My Contacts. Turns out that the Infuse (and others?) only displays what's in the "My Contacts" group if you're syncing to/from Google.

You can change this :)
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Contacts application.</li>
	<li>Activate the menu by pressing the button on the front of your phone - bottom left.</li>
	<li>Click the "More" button on screen</li>
	<li>Select "Display Options"</li>
	<li>Choose your Google account under "Choose contacts to display"</li>
	<li>Select the groups you want displayed.</li>
	<li>Click "Done".</li>
</ol>
Finding little gems like this gets old with new phones pretty quick.
