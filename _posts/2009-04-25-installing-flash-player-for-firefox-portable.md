Portable applications are a wonderful thing. Firefox portable is my favorite - with one downside - it doesn't come with the flash plugin installed. Here's how you fix that:<br /><ul><li>Download the Flash installer .exe from Adobe's site (<a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</a>)</li><li>Use an unzipping program (like 7-zip portable) to open this executable (Within 7-zip the option once you've selected the file is "Open Inside" available if you right-click the file)</li><li>Extract the .dll and the .xpt files to your Plugins folder (Drive:\FirefoxDir\App\Firefox\Plugins)</li><li>Enjoy flash.</li></ul>It's really that simple - and didn't even require a browser restart. Woot!
