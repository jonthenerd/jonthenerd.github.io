This post is more for my own self-reference later, but others may find it helpful too.<br /><br />I've been looking to do some modification to the k-member on my car whenever the weather warms up. This will involve removing the k-member before any of the work can be done. Most seem to do this while the engine is removed, but I'd rather not go through that again. I've been doing some reading on how to do this the safest way with the engine still in the car, and here are the tools I'm looking at:<br /><br />* <a href="http://www.automotivetoolsonline.com/OTC7045B-Front-Coil-Spring-Compressor-OTC-7045B_p_12865.html#">OTC Spring Compressor 7045B (what the GM dealer uses)</a><br />* <a href="http://www.summitracing.com/parts/OTC-4324/?rtype=10">OTC Tools 4324 Tubular Engine Support</a><br />* 4 6-ton pound jack stands<br /><br />It's not the completed task you're most proud of - it's the tool collection you've amassed. Grunt Grunt.
