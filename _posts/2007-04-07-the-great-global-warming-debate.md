In order for a great debate to be a true debate - both sides must be heard.   Do you think you've heard the other side?  I bet you haven't.  I caught this on Digg Videos today and was surprised I hadn't heard about it before.  I suggest clicking <a href="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=4340135300469846467">this link</a> for the full size, but the mini video is below.<br /><br /><embed style="width: 400px; height: 326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=4340135300469846467&amp;hl=en-CA" flashvars=""></embed>
