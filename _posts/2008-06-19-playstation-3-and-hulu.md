From all the research I've done, and the actual experience of trying it, Hulu does not work with the built-in browser on the Playstation 3 (PS3) as of this writing.  The flash version is not new enough to support the site...which is too bad.  From what I've read regarding Flash for Linux on the PS3, no official Adobe plugin exists - as the PS3 uses a PPC based processor...meaning that you're stuck to the free alternatives, which do not yet support the type of streaming required for Hulu.<br /><br />With all the hoopla regarding the PS3 being the center of the media center (and I'd love for it to be - the interface is wonderful), not having a modern flash version cripples any online video potential.  Here's hoping future PS3 updates will make this post irrelivant.
