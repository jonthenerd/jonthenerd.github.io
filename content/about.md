Hi. I’m Jon Badgett.

I’m an optimistic pragmatist, currently employed as a software development manager. My goal is to love what I do, and have those I work with do the same.

I live and work in the north Houston area.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, cooking and eating good food, playing video games, and general tinkering.
