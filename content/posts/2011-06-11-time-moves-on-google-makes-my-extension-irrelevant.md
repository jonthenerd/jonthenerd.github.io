|- And that's a good thing! This morning while working to improve my extension
for Google Calendar, I noticed that Google had added the ability to print
multiple weeks or months straight from the Google Calendar. So where does that
leave my extension? Well... unpublished and deleted at this point. I don't see
any reason to still make the extension available, maintain it, etc. if you can
get the same or better experience straight from Google Calendar. I knew this
would happen at some point. Heck - I was using Google's own url to generate the
printable calendar with a different date range than they were feeding in. A
large part of me is glad that Google finally got around to putting this
functionality in. I'm experiencing a different subset of emotion though. It's a
new thing for me. A personal project of mine is no longer needed and is no
longer free and available. The closest thing I can compare the emotion to is
someone telling you your volunteer services are no longer needed (and they
replaced you with some computer software). It's really quite an odd feeling.
Don't understand me though, I'm very glad that Google put this in place. In
fact - **it's about time!** As the extension is the only free
project I've produced and supported, I feel a little empty without it. What a
strange world this is... where developers feel attached to the code they've
written and released for others' enjoyment. Guess I'll need to find something
else to build and give away!
