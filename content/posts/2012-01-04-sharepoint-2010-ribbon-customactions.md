Developing a CustomAction for the Ribbon and SharePoint 2010? If you're like me - you follow some instructions online, deploy it once to verify it works, then change as needed and redeploy. One catch though - the data needed for the ribbon custom action to work is fetched by the browser and CACHED! So you won't see your changes...until you clear your cache. Stupid but true. You're welcome.
