<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;">Sushi!</span><br /><br />Tonight I tried my hand at making one of my favorite eat-out foods. This is my second try...the first ended up in the trash can.  And which roll did I make?  The classic Americanized sushi - the California Roll.<br /><br />Where did I get my inspiration?  Youtube videos.  Search for "how to sushi rice" and "how to california roll" and enough instructions will appear that even the slowest of cooks...ahem...can figure it out. I must say that the sushi I made tonight, while not tip-top restaurant quality...was really close to it. For the amount of sushi I can make for $5...I'll be eating at home for a while :)
