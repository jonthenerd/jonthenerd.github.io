If you're a developer, or an admistrator, or just command your home machine with
extreme prejudice - you need to read [Scott
Hanselman's 2011 Ultimate Developer and Power Users Tool List for Windows](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2011UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx).
Lots of good utilities to be found there. Some may even change your life...
