From AutoBlog:

> > [Tyler Shipman](http://www.tylerstoy.com/index.html) was an 18-year-old Fiero nut from Frazee, Minnesota. In the middle of restoring his favorite car last October he was diagnosed with terminal
> > cancer, and posted a note on a Fiero forum to ask for help with the restoration so that he wouldn't leave his parents with the burden. He got his wish. In the middle of this crazy all and everything, Tyler is more proof that simple humanity still works. We send our best to Tyler's family and friends. Hat tip to
> > Ryan.

Thought I'd reshare this - this is a very special thing.

**Update (2021-09-19)** while updating my blog and fixing links/markup, I found that the boy mentioned had passed away. There is now an [annual memorial car show in his honor](http://www.tylershipmanmemorialcarshow.com/).
