? Minutes ago, I started to use my Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000
(v2.0)...and the pointer was jumpy...kinda jittery...whenever I moved it left to
right. Up and down was fine though. I resynced the mouse, replace the batteries,
and even restarted...still it was jumpy. I've long since lost the receipt to
this mouse (which I really like...would hate to replace it) - so did some
searching for others who may have had this issue. Found this great post :

. Basically - the little diode under the mouse can get dust or hair on it and
cause this problem. Don't throw away your mouse, just blow some air on the
diode! Fixed mine right up...<br /><br />And here I was dreading going to Best
Buy...
