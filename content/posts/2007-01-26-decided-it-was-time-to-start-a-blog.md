I've been experimenting with Linux more often lately and have found several
blogs out there to be very helpful. I've stumbled upon some pretty good
information and hope to post it here when I stumble upon it from time to
time.

Initially I considered paying for hosting on my own blog - just
to learn the ins and outs of Wordpress or
[CMS Made Simple](http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/). But the truth of
the matter is - I'm more interested in tinkering with the technology than coming
up with sample content. As such, I set out to build a small Linux server/media
center to do my tinkering on. I'll post it's specs in the next
post.

If you're reading this - you either came to my blog
**really** quickly or you've dug through the archives. Welcome to
my blog!
