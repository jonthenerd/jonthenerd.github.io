It comes [baked
in](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.ftpwebrequest.aspx). Yay!

Update: Apparently seeing products that do FTP in .NET for years made me think
this wasn't built in. It's been around since .NET 2.0... Another blogger has
even [created a helper class](http://www.dijksterhuis.org/webclient-class-upload-download-ftp-files/) that encapsulates everything you want to do in .NET with FTP (and
it works on mono!).
