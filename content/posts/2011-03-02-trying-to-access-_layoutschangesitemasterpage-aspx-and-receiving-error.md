If you try to access the SharePoint URL "\_Layouts/ChangeSiteMasterPage.aspx"
and receive the following error:

"One or more field types are not installed properly. Go to the list settings
page to delete these fields."

The "SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure" feature needs to be turned on.
