I'm just about finished backing everything up off of my main machine (Windows 7
32-bit Ultimate). I've heard alot of good things about Windows 7 (read quite a
bit too) - and even decent things about the install process. What's tying me to
Windows is Fallout 3 and the random Windows-only game...sorry Ubuntu, I love ya'
but we just can't go steady yet.

I'll update this post as I install and use this new OS. It feels like getting a new
computer!

-   **Update 2:41pm** - I started the install at 2:20 and am typing this from the same machine with Windows 7 now. Checking the device manager, I've got only 1 device (my ATI TV tuner...don't buy one of
    these) not recognized. Next up - Video drivers, TV Tuner drivers, and some
    apps.
-   **Update 3:16pm** - It looks like my ATI TV tuner doesn't have a listed driver available for Windows 7. Some searching revealed that some had success with using the Vista 64 bit driver from the
    [ATI downloads page](http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx). I installed this driver, but the device manager still showed the unknown device. Choosing to "Update driver", I pointed the wizard to the
    location that the ATI installer had unpacked all the files to (C:\ATI). Windows
    picked up the driver and it's now listed as "ATI Unified AVStream Driver". I'm
    still configuring Windows Media Center, so I'm not sure if this will all work
    out - but the driver installed fine.
-   **Update 3:50pm** - TV Tuner works fine. Getting signal out here in the stix is
    another matter :)
-   **Update 5:47pm** - Got some of my apps installed. Restored Fallout 3 from the
    backup I created back into Steam - only to have to do the Games for Windows Live
    dance (don't update through the game, go get the standalone client). Oh - and
    doing a steam backup of the game doesn't capture any downloadable content you've
    acquired through GFWL. Bummer... at my current internet speed rate - I should be
    able to play Fallout 3 sometime next week.

Overall at this point I'm liking Windows 7. The real test comes tonight when I reshare my printer to
another Windows XP box in the house. Vista was _terrible_ with this...I had to restart
the print spooler and open the printers window every time that machine needed to
print. Here's hoping it's gotten better in 7.

**Update 10/25/2009** - It's been a good while since I installed and I haven't
longed for XP or Vista at all. Printer sharing worked fantastic! No more
restarting the print spooler. Fallout 3 finished installing and it ran the
hardware check to auto-set my video settings. It auto-set higher settings than
my Vista install did - now I can see NPCs faces :) Good times.
