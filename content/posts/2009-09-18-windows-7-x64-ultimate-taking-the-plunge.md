I'm just about finished backing everything up off of my main machine (Windows 7
32-bit Ultimate). I've heard alot of good things about Windows 7 (read quite a
bit too) - and even decent things about the install process. What's tying me to
Windows is Fallout 3 and the random Windows-only game...sorry Ubuntu, I love ya'
but we just can't go steady yet.<br /><br />I'll update this post as I install
and use this new OS. It feels like getting a new
computer!<br /><br /><strong>Update 2:41pm</strong><br />I started the install
at 2:20 and am typing this from the same machine with Windows 7 now. Checking
the device manager, I've got only 1 device (my ATI TV tuner...don't buy one of
these) not recognized. Next up - Video drivers, TV Tuner drivers, and some
apps.<br /><br /><strong>Update 3:16pm</strong><br />It looks like my ATI TV
tuner doesn't have a listed driver available for Windows 7. Some searching
revealed that some had success with using the Vista 64 bit driver from the
<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx">ATI downloads
page</a>. I installed this driver, but the device manager still showed the
unknown device. Choosing to "Update driver", I pointed the wizard to the
location that the ATI installer had unpacked all the files to (C:\ATI). Windows
picked up the driver and it's now listed as "ATI Unified AVStream Driver". I'm
still configuring Windows Media Center, so I'm not sure if this will all work
out - but the driver installed fine.<br /><br /><strong>Update
3:50</strong><br />TV Tuner works fine. Getting signal out here in the stix is
another matter :)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update
5:47</span><br />Got some of my apps installed. Restored Fallout 3 from the
backup I created back into Steam - only to have to do the Games for Windows Live
dance (don't update through the game, go get the standalone client). Oh - and
doing a steam backup of the game doesn't capture any downloadable content you've
acquired through GFWL. Bummer... at my current internet speed rate - I should be
able to play Fallout 3 sometime next week.<br /><br />Overall at this point I'm
liking Windows 7. The real test comes tonight when I reshare my printer to
another Windows XP box in the house. Vista was
<span style="font-style: italic;">terrible</span> with this...I had to restart
the print spooler and open the printers window every time that machine needed to
print. Here's hoping it's gotten better
in 7.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update
10/25/2009</span><br />It's been a good while since I installed and I haven't
longed for XP or Vista at all. Printer sharing worked fantastic! No more
restarting the print spooler. Fallout 3 finished installing and it ran the
hardware check to auto-set my video settings. It auto-set higher settings than
my Vista install did - now I can see NPCs faces :) Good times.
