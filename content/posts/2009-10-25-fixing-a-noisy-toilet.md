I've had to replace the flappers in all of my toilets in the 2 years I've been
in my house. I thought that installing the higher quality flapper would be the
last toilet fixes I'd be doing...I was wrong.<br /><br />First, here's what the
inside of most toilet tanks look
like:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_D1O7K_QiCIk/SuSUw9utgCI/AAAAAAAAA-E/gDVplkPOFFs/s1600-h/toiletTankDiagram.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_D1O7K_QiCIk/SuSUw9utgCI/AAAAAAAAA-E/gDVplkPOFFs/s320/toiletTankDiagram.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5396601822421811234" border="0" /></a><br />Last
night the toilet in the master bath started sounding like somebody was filling
the tank with a high pressure water hose. Checking the tank revealed that water
was shooting out of the top of the fill valve instead of going through the fill
tube. I happened upon
<a href="http://www.rd.com/content/openContent.do;jsessionid=2A9D1EF905EE2381983A667045A7B2E9.app5_rd1?friendlyPath=/17646/article17646.html&amp;contentId=17646">an
article</a> on Reader's Digest's website that broke down the different parts of
the toilet tank and led me to believe that most likely my fill valve could use
some cleaning. It also noted that fill valves are
<span style="font-style: italic;">cheap</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">easy to replace</span>. Sounded great to
me!<br /><br />You should always do your research before making a purchase
(especially ones that could cause property damage...like plumbing items). Lowes
has integrated customer reviews into their website - and perusing the fill valve
items I found their highest rated (and almost least expensive)
<a href="http://korky.com/FillValve528.html">Korky QuietFill Fill Valve</a>.
I've used the Korky flappers and liked them, so this was a fine
choice.<br /><br />Went to Lowes and also found something I'd never seen
before - an in-tank toilet bowl cleaning system that advertises that it only
treats the bowl and won't affect the tank parts. I suspect that I've had to
replace previous flappers because I like to use the little chlorine circles that
you put in the tank to keep the bowl fresh. I figured I'd already be in the
tank, so I'd try this too. I got the "Flush 'n Sprarkle" made by Fluidmaster.
Their website is terrible or I'd provide a link...<br /><br />Combining these
two was a breeze. Make sure to follow the directions on the fill valve or you'll
have a very wet bathroom. Overall - this was an easy home fixit job that anybody
can do.
