I'm putting together a server for some friends to play Unreal Tournament (yes,
the original). I had heard this was doable on Linux, and I have a friend's old
laptop here to play with. I'll be putting good links here that have helped me to
get this working.<br /><br />I got it all setup in a VirtualBox VM, but need it
on the separate machine. This old laptop has a broken screen and no hard
drive...no problem! It will be running headless anyway, and I've also got a 16GB
flash drive. Ubuntu Lucid installs fine on a flash drive - the only
recommendation being that you use ext2, as it's not a journaling file system (it
doesn't write as much to the drive).<br /><br />Helpful
