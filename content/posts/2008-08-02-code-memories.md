Every once in a while I'll start thinking of long-past written code. Lately I've
been thinking of C/C++... This isn't a language I wish to make a living
coding. In fact - many parts of my C/C++ education were /very/ lacking. However,
there are times when I think back to things that I could have done better,
things I really enjoyed coding (Blackjack console app with ASCII cards..heh),
and things I just plain didn't understand or care to.

Quick Google search brought up
[http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
for relearning some of that forgotten knowledge. I make a quick run through and
got as far as classes before taking a breather- which means I learned more
syntax in an hour than in my entire High School programming courses (and almost
as much as 2 semesters of Computer Science....ug).

Amazing what our brains will bring back up when we least expect it. :-/
