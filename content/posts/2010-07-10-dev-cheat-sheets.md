Found [this site](http://devcheatsheet.com/) via
[downloadsquad](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/07/09/devcheatsheet-catalogs-over-1-600-cheat-sheets-for-developers-and-users/).
It has lots of condensed "cheat sheets" for different programming languages,
tools, etc. that could be handy. I know I'll be using the [built-in VS 2010 Code snippets for C#](http://john-sheehan.com/blog/cheatsheets/visual-studio-2010-csharp-snippets.htm).
