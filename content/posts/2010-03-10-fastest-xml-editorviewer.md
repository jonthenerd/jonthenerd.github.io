I use Visual Studio every day for just about all of my development tasks.
However, I attempted to open a large xml file (> 20 megs) and Visual studio
spiked up to 1.5 gigs of memory consumption and I couldn't do anything... My old
standby notepad++ (great editor!) also hung on opening the file. A quick search
yielded <a href="http://www.firstobject.com/dn_editor.htm">First Object's XML
Editor</a>. Worked great. Super fast.
