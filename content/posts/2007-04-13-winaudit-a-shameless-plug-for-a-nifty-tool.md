While surfing the interwebs, checking the emails, etc. I came upon a program
called <a href="http://www.pxserver.com/WinAudit.htm">WinAudit</a>. It's a
FREEware app that can report a lot of things about your machine and output it in
a lot of different formats. Straight from their site: "The programme has
advanced features such as service tag detection, hard-drive failure diagnosis,
network port to process mapping, network connection speed, system availability
statistics as well as WindowsÂ® update and firewall
settings."<br /><br />Anyway - it's pretty neat. My new employer is a "100%
Microsoft Shop", so I'm trying to move more that direction in the things I learn
about and use on a daily basis. I'm all for open source, free software for all,
and beautiful alternative user interfaces...but managing a 100% Microsoft Shop
is surely going to have its peaks. All in all I'm looking forward to the
opportunity. Only question I now have...should I switch my Linux server/media
box to Windows Server 2003?<br /><br />If you've got a handy free tool for the
Windows world that makes your life easier - leave me a comment or two :)
