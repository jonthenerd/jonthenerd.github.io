Published my first Google Chrome extension today, Print Helper for Google
Calendar.

<!--more-->

It allows people to print multiple weeks or months of their Google Calendar(s)
at a time. This is something that Google doesn't show in the print UI - but is
available if you tweak the URL that is sent to generate the printable pages. I'm
not sure why Google doesn't expose the date selection themselves, as it's a very
needed feature for those using Google Apps day to day.

Enjoy!

<strong>Update 1/18/2011: </strong>Released v1.1, which now allows more urls
when determining when to activate the icon. This should resolve the reported
issue. Found that the icon was now appearing on the print preview window, so
released v1.2 which keeps the icon from appearing there.

<strong>Update 2/11/2011: </strong>Released v1.21, which just added the â„¢ to
abide by Google's branding rules for extensions. Released v1.30 - allowing
generated calendars to be in other languages, show/hide weekends, and set week
start day.

<strong>Update ????</strong>The plugin is no longer in the store, as Google
added the cabability to their own calendar UI.
