I decided that in order to tinker without disrupting the smooth operation of my
workhorse PC, I ought to just build a testing box. In the event that I can
actually tinker enough to stop wanting to tinker (like that's going to happen),
I also wanted the PC to serve a dual role as an eventual Media Center PC
(Windows or otherwise). So I laid out some requirements:

-   Multiple Core - I've read that the latest versions of software that play High-Def video
    (DVD & Blu-Ray) recommend having dual core. No reason to skimp on this as many
    inexpensive CPUs have this now
-   Onboard DVI - While I may eventually get a better video card for this system, having the ability to otuput to my HDTV
    using a DVI->HDMI converter will come in really handy.
-   Small Case - I've owned plenty of too-huge computers. This should be able to blend into my entertainment
    setup
-   Maximum Linux compatibility - If I'm going to be running Linux
    and don't want headaches...Linux needs to be able to recognize my hardware
    pretty much out of the box. Not that I can't install drivers/whatnot - but the
    most promising thing when putting together a machine and installing the OS is
    actually seeing that none of your hardware is DOA.

With these goals, I set out to find the parts I wanted. I've had mostly good experiences at
[Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/), and chose to use them again. After several hours of comparison shopping and
checking the Internet for Linux compatibility - I came up with this setup:

-   Case: Apevia X-QPack
-   Motherboard: ASU M2 NBP-VM CSM
-   Processor: AMD Athlon X2 3800 (Socket AM2)
-   Ram: Kingston DDR2 533 1GB
-   Hard Drive: WD 320GB SATA
-   DVD Burner: LG 18X

At the time I purchased the parts - the Intel Core 2 Duos were definitely outperforming their AMD
counterparts. However, the Athlon X2 3800 was cheaper than any Core 2 Duo. I've also had good experiences with
Nvidia chipsets & Linux - so what the hey. I got the ASUS motherboard primarily because of
my excellent experience with prior ASUS mobos. It's also nice that it has onboard DVI.

Everything arrived quickly and nothing was DOA. I did experience some minor sound issues with different
Linux distros and Windows - but not enough to call the motherboard defective or anything.
Probably more of a driver issue. If you are using this motherboard under
windows - I would suggest uninstalling the Nvidia firewall which is installed
when you use the unified driver on the ASUS CD. Find another firewall... Never
really liked the Nvidia one.

I'll detail my Linux installation _fun_ (fun is also code for excrutiating
frustration in some cases) in a future article. Thanks for the read!
