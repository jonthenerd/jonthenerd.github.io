        <p>|- And that&rsquo;s a good thing! This morning while working to improve my extension
for Google Calendar, I noticed that Google had added the ability to print
multiple weeks or months straight from the Google Calendar. So where does that
leave my extension? Well&hellip; unpublished and deleted at this point. I don&rsquo;t see
any reason to still make the extension available, maintain it, etc. if you can
get the same or better experience straight from Google Calendar. I knew this
would happen at some point. Heck - I was using Google&rsquo;s own url to generate the
printable calendar with a different date range than they were feeding in. A
large part of me is glad that Google finally got around to putting this
functionality in. I&rsquo;m experiencing a different subset of emotion though. It&rsquo;s a
new thing for me. A personal project of mine is no longer needed and is no
longer free and available. The closest thing I can compare the emotion to is
someone telling you your volunteer services are no longer needed (and they
replaced you with some computer software). It&rsquo;s really quite an odd feeling.
Don&rsquo;t understand me though, I&rsquo;m very glad that Google put this in place. In
fact - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it&rsquo;s about time!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> As the extension is the only free
project I&rsquo;ve produced and supported, I feel a little empty without it. What a
strange world this is&hellip; where developers feel attached to the code they&rsquo;ve
written and released for others' enjoyment. Guess I&rsquo;ll need to find something
else to build and give away!</p>
