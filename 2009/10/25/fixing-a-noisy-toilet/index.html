        <p>I&rsquo;ve had to replace the flappers in all of my toilets in the 2 years I&rsquo;ve been
in my house. I thought that installing the higher quality flapper would be the
last toilet fixes I&rsquo;d be doing&hellip;I was wrong.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, here&rsquo;s what the
inside of most toilet tanks look
like:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last
night the toilet in the master bath started sounding like somebody was filling
the tank with a high pressure water hose. Checking the tank revealed that water
was shooting out of the top of the fill valve instead of going through the fill
tube. I happened upon
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->an
article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Reader&rsquo;s Digest&rsquo;s website that broke down the different parts of
the toilet tank and led me to believe that most likely my fill valve could use
some cleaning. It also noted that fill valves are
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->cheap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->easy to replace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Sounded great to
me!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You should always do your research before making a purchase
(especially ones that could cause property damage&hellip;like plumbing items). Lowes
has integrated customer reviews into their website - and perusing the fill valve
items I found their highest rated (and almost least expensive)
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Korky QuietFill Fill Valve<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.
I&rsquo;ve used the Korky flappers and liked them, so this was a fine
choice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Went to Lowes and also found something I&rsquo;d never seen
before - an in-tank toilet bowl cleaning system that advertises that it only
treats the bowl and won&rsquo;t affect the tank parts. I suspect that I&rsquo;ve had to
replace previous flappers because I like to use the little chlorine circles that
you put in the tank to keep the bowl fresh. I figured I&rsquo;d already be in the
tank, so I&rsquo;d try this too. I got the &ldquo;Flush &lsquo;n Sprarkle&rdquo; made by Fluidmaster.
Their website is terrible or I&rsquo;d provide a link&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Combining these
two was a breeze. Make sure to follow the directions on the fill valve or you&rsquo;ll
have a very wet bathroom. Overall - this was an easy home fixit job that anybody
can do.</p>
