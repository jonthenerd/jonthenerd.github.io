            <p>I&rsquo;m just about finished backing everything up off of my main machine (Windows 7
32-bit Ultimate). I&rsquo;ve heard alot of good things about Windows 7 (read quite a
bit too) - and even decent things about the install process. What&rsquo;s tying me to
Windows is Fallout 3 and the random Windows-only game&hellip;sorry Ubuntu, I love ya'
but we just can&rsquo;t go steady yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll update this post as I install and use this new OS. It feels like getting a new
computer!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Update 2:41pm</strong> - I started the install at 2:20 and am typing this from the same machine with Windows 7 now. Checking the device manager, I&rsquo;ve got only 1 device (my ATI TV tuner&hellip;don&rsquo;t buy one of
these) not recognized. Next up - Video drivers, TV Tuner drivers, and some
apps.</li>
<li><strong>Update 3:16pm</strong> - It looks like my ATI TV tuner doesn&rsquo;t have a listed driver available for Windows 7. Some searching revealed that some had success with using the Vista 64 bit driver from the
<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx">ATI downloads page</a>. I installed this driver, but the device manager still showed the unknown device. Choosing to &ldquo;Update driver&rdquo;, I pointed the wizard to the
location that the ATI installer had unpacked all the files to (C:\ATI). Windows
picked up the driver and it&rsquo;s now listed as &ldquo;ATI Unified AVStream Driver&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m
still configuring Windows Media Center, so I&rsquo;m not sure if this will all work
out - but the driver installed fine.</li>
<li><strong>Update 3:50pm</strong> - TV Tuner works fine. Getting signal out here in the stix is
another matter :)</li>
<li><strong>Update 5:47pm</strong> - Got some of my apps installed. Restored Fallout 3 from the
backup I created back into Steam - only to have to do the Games for Windows Live
dance (don&rsquo;t update through the game, go get the standalone client). Oh - and
doing a steam backup of the game doesn&rsquo;t capture any downloadable content you&rsquo;ve
acquired through GFWL. Bummer&hellip; at my current internet speed rate - I should be
able to play Fallout 3 sometime next week.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall at this point I&rsquo;m liking Windows 7. The real test comes tonight when I reshare my printer to
another Windows XP box in the house. Vista was <em>terrible</em> with this&hellip;I had to restart
the print spooler and open the printers window every time that machine needed to
print. Here&rsquo;s hoping it&rsquo;s gotten better in 7.</p>
<p><strong>Update 10/25/2009</strong> - It&rsquo;s been a good while since I installed and I haven&rsquo;t
longed for XP or Vista at all. Printer sharing worked fantastic! No more
restarting the print spooler. Fallout 3 finished installing and it ran the
hardware check to auto-set my video settings. It auto-set higher settings than
my Vista install did - now I can see NPCs faces :) Good times.</p>
