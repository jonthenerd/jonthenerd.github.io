<p>I’m an optimistic pragmatist and enjoy a lot of &ldquo;nerdy&rdquo; things. This is my blog, which I use for putting to paper (screen?) my thoughts on a variety of subjects, often connected to my work as a software development manager but other times to my personal projects or interests. Many times, the posts are for my own future benefit to remember how or why I did something. I put them on the internet as there&rsquo;s at least some chance they&rsquo;ll help somebody else, and that&rsquo;s what the internet is for (to me).</p>
<p>The content of this blog is entirely my opinions, and do not reflect the views, positions, or anything else of my employer, people I work with, or anybody but myself. If there&rsquo;s something on this site you find fault or issue with, please let me know in the comments of the post.</p>
<p>If you need to reach me directly, I&rsquo;d be happy to start a conversation on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-badgett">LinkedIn</a>. I also respond to emails address to <em>Jon</em> at this website&rsquo;s domain.</p>
