            <p>I managed to purchase one of these little gems in late April. I&rsquo;ve been a
longtime fan of Linux and Asus in general, so the thought of a little laptop
running the free OS was enough to keep me dreaming until I broke down and
ordered one. I bought a 7&quot; model with the4 gig hard drive and an extra 2 gigs of
ram. I did the ram install myself and setup the Advanced Desktop to my liking.
The first several days were wonderful. I intended to use this to check email,
read the internet, and watch streaming video piped to my TV. Then I started to
notice some things&hellip;the newness was wearing off.</p>
<p><strong>First - this thing is tiny.</strong>
I knew that going in and anyone thinking about one should know that
too. The idea of a tiny laptop didn&rsquo;t scare me - I have medium to large size
hands and work with computers every day. If anything a little less weight to
carry would be good. I found the weight to be fine. However, I found the
keyboard to be of just plain bad quality. What most have blamed on big fingers -
I believe is a flaw in the design. My O and N keys consistently required more
force to press than others in order to register a keystroke. In addition, the
cramped spaces inside the device made it such that using a headphone plug on the
side of the laptop was extremely difficult - hard to put in and hard to take
out. The microphone port was fine&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Second - Linux is good. Asus branded Linux&hellip;not so hot.</strong>
Initially, I was overjoyed that the flavor of Linux
on the eeePC was Debian based - gotta love apt-get. However, repositories of
definite quality and dependability are slim to none. Luckily, the eee has most
of what you need - just hope you don&rsquo;t need to update in the
future.</p>
<p><strong>Third - drivers within the default Linux for the wireless nic are just poor.</strong>
Posts on eeeUser.com can confirm this for anyone. If you&rsquo;re
connecting to an unsecured wireless access point - you&rsquo;ll be pleased with the
eee. I don&rsquo;t give away my internet connection, and so have a standard Linksys
WRT54g configured for WPA with a typed in key. Connecting to this with the eee
got worse every time I booted the device - to the point of waiting for up to an
hour for it to connect. It just didn&rsquo;t seem to receive DHCP offers. Contrast
that to my workhorse Lenovo laptop that connected every time before I could even
log in to Windows. I don&rsquo;t doubt that Asus used good quality parts - I believe
that using hacked up drivers on a commerical product that results in a boot time
of under 1 minute and a WPA access time of an hour is poor form. Shame on you
Asus. I love Linux - and I even prefer Asus for my motherboards. But surely
there are better supported wireless chipsets out there for Linux they could have
used&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Fourth - Adobe Flash on Linux works well, for the most part.</strong>
However, the speed of the eee coupled with poor Flash performance on Linux makes
playing back videos on Hulu jittery and unwatchable. I tried every trick I could
find, stopping only before overclocking (not worth it in my book). Perhaps the
next Flash version will make this better? Let&rsquo;s all hope so.</p>
<p>I could have lived with everything above except for the 3rd point. A device meant to be
instant-on taking that long to connect to a wireless network I know is in good
working order is infuriating. If I can boot up my Lenovo laptop with Visual
Studio, Office 2007, etc. on it and beat the eee to the Internet - the eee is
now just a paper weight. For that reason - the eeePC was the first item I&rsquo;ve
sold on eBay. I have no doubt that 90% of the audience of the eee loves it.
Heck - I think it&rsquo;s a brilliant device and one we&rsquo;ll see cloned 100 times over.
I&rsquo;ll probably buy one of those clones. But of all the praise for the eee - it is
still a niche product meant for a select few. Namely those with: small hands,
limited application needs, unsecured wireless routers, and flashblock installed
in FireFox.</p>
<p>Anybody have one of the eee Clones with Linux and good WPA wireless? Maybe I&rsquo;ll try my luck again.</p>
