        <p>Trying to delete a field in a SharePoint library and get the message &ldquo;Cannot
complete this action. Pleast try again.&rdquo;? This drove me nuts, as even invoking
the delete method via the object model gives this message. What I found to allow
a delete was pushing down changes via the content type gallery in the site
collection (if the field was ever a part of that content type). This can be
found by going to the following:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->_ Site Settings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->_ Site Content Type
Gallery<!-- raw HTML omitted -->_ Choose Content Type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->_ Advanced Settings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->_ Make sure
radio button &ldquo;Update all content types inheriting from this type&rdquo; is
checked<!-- raw HTML omitted -->_ Click OK<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had several libraries with several fields
that had this issue (all fields used to be a part of the content type but had
since been orphaned due to changing the definition of the content type in the
elements.xml) and now they are all clean and free of these unneeded
fields.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If only the error would have told me something
meaningful&hellip;because trying again was surely never going to fix it.</p>
