            <p>I ran across this the other day and found it funny. A google search reveals that
it may be from a mailing list from around 2000.</p>
<p><strong>If clients treated architects like they treat software designers…</strong></p>
<p>Dear Mr. Architect,</p>
<p>Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of
what I need, so you should use your discretion. My house should have somewhere
between two and forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure the plans are such that the
bedrooms can be easily added or deleted. When you bring the blueprints to me, I
will make the final decision of what I want. Also, bring me the cost breakdown
for each configuration so that I can arbitrarily pick one.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the house I ultimately choose must cost less than the one I am
currently living in. Make sure, however, that you correct all the deficiencies
that exist in my current house (the floor of my kitchen vibrates when I walk
across it, and the walls don&rsquo;t have nearly enough insulation in
them).</p>
<p>As you design, also keep in mind that I want to keep yearly
maintenance costs as low as possible. This should mean the incorporation of
extra-cost features like aluminum, vinyl, or composite siding. (If you choose
not to specify aluminum, be prepared to explain your decision in
detail.)</p>
<p>Please take care that modern design practices and the latest
materials are used in construction of the house, as I want it to be a showplace
for the most up-to-date ideas and methods. Be alerted, however, that kitchen
should be designed to accommodate, among other things, my 1952 Gibson
refrigerator.</p>
<p>To insure that you are building the correct house for
our entire family, make certain that you contact each of our children, and also
our in-laws. My mother-in-law will have very strong feelings about how the house
should be designed, since she visits us at least once a year. Make sure that you
weigh all of these options carefully and come to the right decision. I, however,
retain the right to overrule any choices that you make.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t
bother me with small details right now. Your job is to develop the overall plans
for the house: get the big picture. At this time, for example, it is not
appropriate to be choosing the color of the carpet. However, keep in mind that
my wife likes blue.</p>
<p>Also, do not worry at this time about acquiring
the resources to build the house itself. Your first priority is to develop
detailed plans and specifications. Once I approve these plans, however, I would
expect the house to be under roof within 48 hours.</p>
<p>While you are
designing this house specifically for me, keep in mind that sooner or later I
will have to sell it to someone else. It therefore should have appeal to a wide
variety of potential buyers. Please make sure before you finalize the plans that
there is a consensus of the population in my area that they like the features
this house has. I advise you to run up and look at my neighbor&rsquo;s house he
constructed last year. We like it a great deal. It has many features that we
would also like in our new home, particularly the 75-foot swimming pool. With
careful engineering, I believe that you can design this into our new house
without impacting the final cost.</p>
<p>Please prepare a complete set of
blueprints. It is not necessary at this time to do the real design, since they
will be used only for construction bids. Be advised, however, that you will be
held accountable for any increase of construction costs as a result of later
design changes.</p>
<p>You must be thrilled to be working on such an
interesting project as this! To be able to use the latest techniques and
materials and to be given such freedom in your designs is something that can&rsquo;t
happen very often. Contact me as soon as possible with your complete ideas and
plans.&lt;</p>
<p>P.S.: My wife has just told me that she disagrees with many of
the instructions I&rsquo;ve given you in this letter. As architect, it is your
responsibility to resolve these differences. I have tried in the past and have
been unable to accomplish this. If you can&rsquo;t handle this responsibility, I will
have to find another architect.&lt;</p>
<p>P.P.S.: Perhaps what I need is not a
house at all, but a travel trailer. Please advise me as soon as possible if this
is the case.</p>
