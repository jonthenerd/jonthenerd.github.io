      <description>I decided to rebuild my blog atop Hugo, the &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites.&amp;rdquo; I did this for a few reasons:
  GitHub has been diligent in reminding me that there are security vulnerabilities in the dependencies of my blog. I used jekyll for the static site building, a collection of npm packages for some glue-code in the build process, and based my theme on twitter bootstrap. All of this adds up to a lot of dependencies to keep up with, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been blogging for a while&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next in this series on the SharePoint Framework are extensions.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/extensions/overview-extensions&#34;&gt;According to docs.microsoft.com, SPFx Extensions allow for the customization of multiple facets of the SharePoint experience&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on differences I made while following the online tutorial and my
observations on capabilities and impacts of SPFx Application Customizer
extensions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

just plain don&amp;rsquo;t work) on certain versions of node? What to do?
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/creationix/nvm&#34;&gt;Node Version Manager (NVM) allows you to install and switch between them &amp;ldquo;with ease&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
(quotes added as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post as I get it installed for the first

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SharePoint 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve created some site columns, added them to a content type, then added
that content type to a list/library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You add some test data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a full crawl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create managed properties, mapping them to the crawled properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run another full crawl (to populate the managed properties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed properties on search results are missing.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>When using the stsadm command:
stsadm.exe -o migrateuser oldlogin &amp;ldquo;domainusername&amp;rdquo; -newlogin &amp;ldquo;domainnewusername&amp;rdquo;
We received this error message:
Value cannot be null. Parameter name: userProfileApplicationProxy
If you look in the ULS logs, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that there is an Access Denied event occuring. We were able to resolve this by going into Central Administration, selecting the User Service Application, and ensuring that the administrator account being used to run the above command has Full Control rights to the Service Application.</description>

      <description>These are my notes while trying to diagnose and better understnad some issues and oddities with the SharePoint 2010 User Profile Service Application.
If you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to populate pictures into people&amp;rsquo;s profiles, you&amp;rsquo;ll be using the Update-SPProfilePhotoStore powershell cmdlet after a normal sync (full or incremental - or your custom built one). This cmdlet is in the Microsoft.Office.Server.UserProfiles dll, specifically the Microsoft.Office.Server.UserProfiles.PowerShell.SPCmdletUserProfilePhotoStore class. Thanks to the goodness that is Redgate Reflector(a must have for any SP developer), we can get a more clear undertanding of what the cmdlet is doing.</description>

      <description>Developing a CustomAction for the Ribbon and SharePoint 2010? If you&amp;rsquo;re like me - you follow some instructions online, deploy it once to verify it works, then change as needed and redeploy. One catch though - the data needed for the ribbon custom action to work is fetched by the browser and CACHED! So you won&amp;rsquo;t see your changes&amp;hellip;until you clear your cache. Stupid but true. You&amp;rsquo;re welcome.</description>

      <description>What else do you need?
Custom User Profile Properties (and several of the Out of Box ones) depend on a Managed Metadata Service Application being setup and associated with the application you&amp;rsquo;re working with. This is fairly trivial to setup. Just remember that after you set it up via the UI, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start it on the &amp;ldquo;Manage services on this server&amp;rdquo; page, and then perform an IIS reset. Forgetting these will keep your Managed Metadata service from working.</description>

      <description>|- and so on with the error message. Do these also fit your situation? 1) The error happens when running a console application 2) Using PowerShell works to access the SPSite, SPWeb, or SPWebApplication that you&amp;rsquo;re accessing in your console application How do you fix this? Change your build platform target to x64 instead of x86. Also keep in mind that this is a per build configuration setting (so you have the setting for Debug and Release compile modes).</description>

      <description>This can be useful when you need a file to be right off the root of your Internet facing site - files like robots.txt, sitemap.xml, or the verification file for Google Webmaster tools. We&amp;rsquo;ll take advantage of PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s ability to use any .NET methods along with the Files collection on each SPWeb in SharePoint. $fileBytes = [system.io.file]::ReadAllBytes(&amp;quot;c:\the\full\path\to\your\file.txt&amp;quot;); $site = Get-SPSite &amp;quot;http://yourdomain:portifneeded&amp;quot;; $site.RootWeb.Files.Add(&amp;quot;file.txt&amp;quot;, $fileBytes, $true); This will result in a file.txt located at &amp;ldquo;http://yourdomain:portifneeded/file.</description>

      <title>SharePoint 2010: Finding the largest document library in a site collection</title>

      <description>SharePoint 2007 came with a page (storman.aspx) dedicated to showing you how much space each of the lists in your site collection were taking up. SharePoint 2010 removed this page. Luckily, SharePoint 2010 SP1 added it back in. But what if you&amp;rsquo;re still haven&amp;rsquo;t updated to SP1 and you&amp;rsquo;re getting warnings/errors about running out of space?
Obviously - up the space so as to avoid additional noise from your users. Then - figure out which libraries are taking up the most space.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While doing some testing after upgrading my dev machine to SP1, I ran into two
separate issues when trying to delete a web through the UI by using the &amp;ldquo;Sites
and Workspaces&amp;rdquo; link in Site Settings. Deleting through powershell worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to copy+paste this later&amp;hellip; This will disable a feature on all web applications in a farm. Very convenient for when you&amp;rsquo;re removing a feature from a solution.

      <description>This same PowerShell could be used for any other list to remove all of the items. I just needed it to remove the OOB reusable content.
$siteColTemp = Get-SPSite &amp;#34;http://yourSiteCollectionUrl&amp;#34;; $reusableContentList = $siteColTemp.RootWeb.Lists[&amp;#34;Reusable Content&amp;#34;]; $reusableContentItems = $reusableContentList.Items; $reusableContentItemsCount = $reusableContentItems.Count; for($x=$reusableContentItemsCount-1;$x -ge 0; $x--){ $reusableContentItems[$x].Delete(); } </description>

      <description>|- And that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing! This morning while working to improve my extension for Google Calendar, I noticed that Google had added the ability to print multiple weeks or months straight from the Google Calendar. So where does that leave my extension? Well&amp;hellip; unpublished and deleted at this point. I don&amp;rsquo;t see any reason to still make the extension available, maintain it, etc. if you can get the same or better experience straight from Google Calendar.</description>

      <description>This idea comes from Kirk Hofer&amp;rsquo;s blog, but modfied to use the SharePoint 2010 powershell commandlets and not care about specifying credentials in the script. I figured most people would just keep using the credentials specified in their scheduled task. The script loads the SharePoint plugin, enumerates the zones, and sends a request to each one.
Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell; function Get-WebPage([string]$url) { $wc = new-object net.webclient; $wc.credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials; $pageContents = $wc.</description>

      <description>Since the MSDN documentation for Default Custom Action Loacations and IDs is unreliable (they look to have copy+pasted the information from the SharePoint 2007 documentation), our only sure bet is to browse the file system and find the custom action IDs and groups ourselves.
I had need of this information today, and found the items from the site settings page located at:
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\TEMPLATE\FEATURES\SiteSettings\SiteSettings.xml
For those looking specifically for it, here is the custom action for &amp;ldquo;Delete this site&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>In migrating some WebParts from SP2007 to SP2010, I came across a webpart that implements ICallbackEventHandler. This webpart was working fine when placed on the page, but did not work correctly in the webpart gallery. The specific error message being received was:
  The target &amp;lsquo;ctl00$PlaceHolderMain$ctl00&amp;rsquo; for the callback could not be found or did not implement ICallbackEventHandler
  This error is due to the webpart being added to the preview page dynamically at runtime.</description>

This site using built-in SharePoint web services and the download.aspx page in the \_layouts directory to facilitate lookup of related documents and provide download capability. The issue? Anonymous users can&amp;rsquo;t use any of the application pages in the \_layouts folder.
Lots of head scratching and some creative Google searches led me to the &amp;ldquo;DotNetIdeas&amp;rdquo; blog, specifically this post.</description>

This worked great each time I&amp;rsquo;d test it out and add some additional functionality. When I finished the control, I did a little harder testing by hitting the refresh button in my browser over and over again. Randomly, my control wouldn&amp;rsquo;t render. Other times it would be fine.</description>

This drove me nuts, as even invoking the delete method via the object model gives this message. What I found to allow a delete was pushing down changes via the content type gallery in the site collection (if the field was ever a part of that content type). This can be found by going to the following:</description>

In the middle of restoring his favorite car last October he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and posted a note on a Fiero forum to ask for help with the restoration so that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave his parents with the burden. He got his wish. In the middle of this crazy all and everything, Tyler is more proof that simple humanity still works.</description>

      <description>This post is more for my own self-reference later, but others may find it helpful too.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking to do some modification to the k-member on my car whenever the weather warms up. This will involve removing the k-member before any of the work can be done. Most seem to do this while the engine is removed, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather not go through that again. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some reading on how to do this the safest way with the engine still in the car, and here are the tools I&amp;rsquo;m looking at:</description>

      <description>I got this from a friend and have found it very useful for debugging my XSLT from content query web parts and data view web parts in Visual Studio. The below XSLT will output the source XML given to it:
&amp;lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; xmlns:xsl=&amp;#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&amp;#34; xmlns:msxsl=&amp;#34;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt&amp;#34; exclude-result-prefixes=&amp;#34;msxsl&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:output method=&amp;#34;xml&amp;#34; indent=&amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:template match=&amp;#34;@ node()&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:copy&amp;gt; &amp;lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&amp;#34;@ node()&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:copy&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:template&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:stylesheet&amp;gt; </description>

      <description>I ran across this the other day and found it funny. A google search reveals that it may be from a mailing list from around 2000.
If clients treated architects like they treat software designers…
Dear Mr. Architect,
Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of what I need, so you should use your discretion. My house should have somewhere between two and forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms can be easily added or deleted.</description>

      <description>Using IE8 Standards Mode with MOSS has been fairly trouble-free so far. However, the richhtmlfield editor throws javascript errors when the page is in IE8 Standards mode. Without switching to the Telerik control or defaulting all of my pages to IE7 mode - there is a simpler fix!
Enable IE7 compatability mode only on your edit pages. My master page had the IE8 meta tag:
&amp;lt;meta equiv=&amp;#34;X-UA-Compatible&amp;#34; content=&amp;#34;IE=8&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; right under the head element.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had to replace the flappers in all of my toilets in the 2 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been in my house. I thought that installing the higher quality flapper would be the last toilet fixes I&amp;rsquo;d be doing&amp;hellip;I was wrong.
First, here&amp;rsquo;s what the inside of most toilet tanks look like:
Last night the toilet in the master bath started sounding like somebody was filling the tank with a high pressure water hose.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just about finished backing everything up off of my main machine (Windows 7 32-bit Ultimate). I&amp;rsquo;ve heard alot of good things about Windows 7 (read quite a bit too) - and even decent things about the install process. What&amp;rsquo;s tying me to Windows is Fallout 3 and the random Windows-only game&amp;hellip;sorry Ubuntu, I love ya&#39; but we just can&amp;rsquo;t go steady yet.
I&amp;rsquo;ll update this post as I install and use this new OS.</description>

      <description>? Minutes ago, I started to use my Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 (v2.0)&amp;hellip;and the pointer was jumpy&amp;hellip;kinda jittery&amp;hellip;whenever I moved it left to right. Up and down was fine though. I resynced the mouse, replace the batteries, and even restarted&amp;hellip;still it was jumpy. I&amp;rsquo;ve long since lost the receipt to this mouse (which I really like&amp;hellip;would hate to replace it) - so did some searching for others who may have had this issue.</description>

      <description>Tonight I tried my hand at making one of my favorite eat-out foods. This is my second try&amp;hellip;the first ended up in the trash can. And which roll did I make? The classic Americanized sushi - the California Roll.
Where did I get my inspiration? Youtube videos. Search for &amp;ldquo;how to sushi rice&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how to california roll&amp;rdquo; and enough instructions will appear that even the slowest of cooks&amp;hellip;ahem&amp;hellip;can figure it out.</description>

      <description>I was fortunate to get a new laptop at work recently. I took my time on a long weekend configuring it to my satisfaction, but was annoyed by an annoying &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; noise coming from the speakers after every sound. A little further testing showed that this was only when the machine was on battery power. This post on notebookreview and this post on the OpenSuse forums point to incorrect power management settings for the sound hardware.</description>

      <description>Every once in a while I&amp;rsquo;ll start thinking of long-past written code. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of C/C++&amp;hellip; This isn&amp;rsquo;t a language I wish to make a living coding. In fact - many parts of my C/C++ education were /very/ lacking. However, there are times when I think back to things that I could have done better, things I really enjoyed coding (Blackjack console app with ASCII cards..heh), and things I just plain didn&amp;rsquo;t understand or care to.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re using an automated tool to create your user accounts and assign a Home Folder (a mapped drive pointing to shared location on a server) - make certain that the property has a colon after the drive letter (e.g. Z: not Z). Without the colon, the drive will not be mapped on user log on. How do you know if this property is set correctly? Active Directory Users and Computers won&amp;rsquo;t show you.</description>

      <description>I just finished reading Chainfire, by Terry Goodkind. I had taken a 2 year hiatus from reading the series and finally returned to it. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to pick up recreational reading, I highly recommend the series. It starts with &amp;ldquo;Wizard&amp;rsquo;s First Rule&amp;rdquo;. Truly one of the best series of our time.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been a longtime fan of Linux and Asus in general, so the thought of a little laptop running the free OS was enough to keep me dreaming until I broke down and ordered one. I bought a 7&amp;quot; model with the4 gig hard drive and an extra 2 gigs of ram. I did the ram install myself and setup the Advanced Desktop to my liking.</description>

My largest project thus far has been an ever growing inventory script (now a .NET 2 app) that reports information back to a SQL database. This app is run on a schedule by a service I wrote. The script collects great pieces of information - everything from the screen resolution being used to information on SQL Server instances on the device (yep - inventories servers too!</description>

The online manual doesn&amp;rsquo;t show its location - but you need to complete disassemble the laptop down to removing the main board. The CMOS battery is located on the underside of the board toward the front of the laptop. Needless to say - the last four hours are hours I&amp;rsquo;ll never get back :-/</description>

What games are included on this list? Pretty much all Lucas Arts games&amp;hellip;Monkey Island (1-4), Loom, Day of the Tentacle, etc. Because of my age, these games (for the most part) came out before I was old enough to realize that I needed to go buy them.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a FREEware app that can report a lot of things about your machine and output it in a lot of different formats. Straight from their site: &amp;ldquo;The programme has advanced features such as service tag detection, hard-drive failure diagnosis, network port to process mapping, network connection speed, system availability statistics as well as Windows® update and firewall settings.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that some of them were just ports of their Windows or Mac OS X counterparts&amp;hellip;but I never had to install wine (a compatibility layer for running Windows programs). Well you know that torrent app I recommended? kTorrent?

      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve tried Ubuntu (or Linux for that matter). Several times in the past few years (since 2002 actually), I&amp;rsquo;d get the &amp;ldquo;Linux Bug&amp;rdquo; and repartition my hard drive to be able to try out some new distro. This would normally come about after I&amp;rsquo;d read some positive review of said distro (or from a friend). What have I tried in the past? I started out on Mandrake (now Mandriva), moved to SUSE 8 &amp;amp; 9, then MEPIS (great distro btw), and now Ubuntu.</description>

Initially I considered paying for hosting on my own blog - just to learn the ins and outs of Wordpress or CMS Made Simple. But the truth of the matter is - I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in tinkering with the technology than coming up with sample content.</description>

      <description>I decided that in order to tinker without disrupting the smooth operation of my workhorse PC, I ought to just build a testing box. In the event that I can actually tinker enough to stop wanting to tinker (like that&amp;rsquo;s going to happen), I also wanted the PC to serve a dual role as an eventual Media Center PC (Windows or otherwise). So I laid out some requirements:
 Multiple Core - I&amp;rsquo;ve read that the latest versions of software that play High-Def video (DVD &amp;amp; Blu-Ray) recommend having dual core.</description>
