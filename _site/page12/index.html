                            <p>I’m just about finished backing everything up off of my main machine (Windows 7 32-bit Ultimate). I’ve heard alot of good things about Windows 7 (read quite a bit too) - and even decent things about the install process. What’s tying me to Windows is Fallout 3 and the random Windows-only game…sorry Ubuntu, I love ya’ but we just can’t go steady yet.<br /><br />I’ll update this post as I install and use this new OS. It feels like getting a new computer!<br /><br /><strong>Update 2:41pm</strong><br />I started the install at 2:20 and am typing this from the same machine with Windows 7 now. Checking the device manager, I’ve got only 1 device (my ATI TV tuner…don’t buy one of these) not recognized. Next up - Video drivers, TV Tuner drivers, and some apps.<br /><br /><strong>Update 3:16pm</strong><br />It looks like my ATI TV tuner doesn’t have a listed driver available for Windows 7. Some searching revealed that some had success with using the Vista 64 bit driver from the <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx">ATI downloads page</a>. I installed this driver, but the device manager still showed the unknown device. Choosing to “Update driver”, I pointed the wizard to the location that the ATI installer had unpacked all the files to (C:\ATI). Windows picked up the driver and it’s now listed as “ATI Unified AVStream Driver”. I’m still configuring Windows Media Center, so I’m not sure if this will all work out - but the driver installed fine.<br /><br /><strong>Update 3:50</strong><br />TV Tuner works fine. Getting signal out here in the stix is another matter :)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 5:47</span><br />Got some of my apps installed. Restored Fallout 3 from the backup I created back into Steam - only to have to do the Games for Windows Live dance (don’t update through the game, go get the standalone client). Oh - and doing a steam backup of the game doesn’t capture any downloadable content you’ve acquired through GFWL. Bummer… at my current internet speed rate - I should be able to play Fallout 3 sometime next week.<br /><br />Overall at this point I’m liking Windows 7. The real test comes tonight when I reshare my printer to another Windows XP box in the house. Vista was <span style="font-style: italic;">terrible</span> with this…I had to restart the print spooler and open the printers window every time that machine needed to print. Here’s hoping it’s gotten better in 7.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 10/25/2009</span><br />It’s been a good while since I installed and I haven’t longed for XP or Vista at all. Printer sharing worked fantastic! No more restarting the print spooler. Fallout 3 finished installing and it ran the hardware check to auto-set my video settings. It auto-set higher settings than my Vista install did - now I can see NPCs faces :) Good times.</p>

                            <p>Minutes ago, I started to use my Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 (v2.0)…and the pointer was jumpy…kinda jittery…whenever I moved it left to right. Up and down was fine though. I resynced the mouse, replace the batteries, and even restarted…still it was jumpy. I’ve long since lost the receipt to this mouse (which I really like…would hate to replace it) -  so did some searching for others who may have had this issue. Found this great post: <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2008/03/05/50374.aspx">http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/keith/archive/2008/03/05/50374.aspx</a> .  Basically - the little diode under the mouse can get dust or hair on it and cause this problem. Don’t throw away your mouse, just blow some air on the diode! Fixed mine right up…<br /><br />And here I was dreading going to Best Buy…</p>

This is my second try…the first ended up in the trash can.  And which roll did I make?  The classic Americanized sushi - the California Roll.<br /><br />Where did I get my inspiration?  Youtube videos.  Search for “how to sushi rice” and “how to california roll” and enough instructions will appear that even the slowest of cooks…ahem…can figure it out. I must say that the sushi I made tonight, while not tip-top restaurant quality…was really close to it. For the amount of sushi I can make for $5…I’ll be eating at home for a while :)</p>

                            <p>I was fortunate to get a new laptop at work recently.  I took my time on a long weekend configuring it to my satisfaction, but was annoyed by an annoying “pop” noise coming from the speakers after every sound.  A little further testing showed that this was only when the machine was on battery power.  <a href="http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?p=3497920">This post</a> on notebookreview and <a href="http://forums.opensuse.org/hardware/388736-strange-pop-click-sound-speakers-every-time.html">this post</a> on the OpenSuse forums point to incorrect power management settings for the sound hardware.  There really isn’t much out there about this, until you start searching for SoundMax popping issues.  This led me to a new driver for the T61 - which has fixed the popping noise.  This is my first experience using Lenovo’s site for drivers and downloads… and it’s great.  I didn’t have to read through any readmes to clearly see what had changed in each driver revision - and that a “clicking noise” had been fixed in a past driver revision. <br /><br />Is this news?  No.  I’m a happy guy though and will look at Lenovo laptops in the future from this experience.  Keep it up Lenovo!</p>

                            <p>Every once in a while I’ll start thinking of long-past written code.  Lately I’ve been thinking of C/C++…  This isn’t a language I wish to make a language coding.  In fact - many parts of my C/C++ education were /very/ lacking.  However, there are times when I think back to things that I could have done better, things I really enjoyed coding (Blackjack console app with ASCII cards..heh), and things I just plain didn’t understand or care to.<br /><br />Quick Google search brought up <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a> for relearning some of that forgotten knowledge.  I make a quick run through and got as far as classes before taking a breather- which means I learned more syntax in an hour than in my entire High School programming courses (and almost as much as 2 semesters of Computer Science….ug).<br /><br />Amazing what our brains will bring back up when we least expect it. :-/</p>
