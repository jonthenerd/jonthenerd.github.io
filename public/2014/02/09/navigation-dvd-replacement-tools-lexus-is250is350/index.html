<h1>Navigation DVD Replacement Tools - Lexus IS250/IS350</h1>
<p>|- I decided to upgrade the navigation DVD in my car. Being who I am, this is a
DIY project (once you get the DVD, of course).</p>
<p>Followed the
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->instructions
from Sewell Parts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I hit a snag&hellip; what precision screwdrivers would fit? I
dug out my bag o' tools and found the smallest screwdrivers. Tried them. No
dice. A friend of mine has a 2007 LS 460 and I noticed he had these tools in his
trunk in a special bag. Searching my car, I could find no such tools. I couldn&rsquo;t
find much on the internet about this either. Where are the navigation DVD
removal picks/screwdrivers in a Lexus IS 250/350? They&rsquo;re in the tool bag that
has the tire iron. It&rsquo;s somewhat L shaped, and mine was next to the spare tire.
If you open the bag, the location of these tools is easy to overlook.</p>
