<h1>CMS Made Simple - Post-Upgrade to v1.11.11</h1>
<p>After finishing an upgrade of another site&rsquo;s CMS Made Simple to version 1.11.11,
I found that in certain areas I was seeing warning messages at the top of the
screen after editing calendar events within CGCalendar.</p>
<p>They looked like this:</p>
<p>[code] Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
(output started at /home4/user/public_html/admin/moduleinterface.php:99) in
/home4/user/public_html/include.php on line 96</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Solution<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The solution I found was to change my
Administration Theme preference from the older &ldquo;NCleanGrey&rdquo; to the newer
&ldquo;OneEleven&rdquo;. This option is under My Preferences -&gt; My Account -&gt; User
Preferences.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tracing it down<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;m fairly new to PHP, having developed C#
primarily the last few years. However, I believe what&rsquo;s causing this is that
within the moduleinterface.php file (line 99), it&rsquo;s calling a &ldquo;ShowMessage&rdquo;
function that&rsquo;s supposed to exist within your preferred theme. The NCleanGrey
theme has no such function, while the newer OneEleven theme does. Why this lack
of a function causes it to yield these particular error messages, I have no
idea. I&rsquo;m trying to post a bug report on this, so perhaps it can be fixed in the
next version of CMSMS. Until then, I&rsquo;d suggest just using the new theme.</p>
