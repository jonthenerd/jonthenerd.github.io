<h1>CMS Made Simple &amp; HostGator - Can&#39;t upload files</h1>
<p>|-</p>
<p>I administer a CMS Made Simple site that runs on HostGator. I got a report from
a user that they couldn&rsquo;t upload any files. Strange! I checked it out, and
neither could I (through the web interface). I could upload a file straight to
the /uploads directory, but I couldn&rsquo;t delete the file. It would complain about
my actions being limited to the uploads folder&hellip; so it thought I wasn&rsquo;t in it?
Logged into HostGator&rsquo;s cPanel and found that my root path had changed from
/home to /home4 &hellip; no notice from HostGator about this, it just changed.
Changed the config.php of the CMS Made Simple site to have /home4 wherever /home
was before - all is working now.</p>
