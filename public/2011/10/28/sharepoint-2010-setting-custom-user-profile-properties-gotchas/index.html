<h1>SharePoint 2010: Setting custom User Profile properties Gotchas</h1>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What else do you need?</p>
<p>Custom User Profile Properties (and several of the Out of Box ones) depend on a
Managed Metadata Service Application being setup and associated with the
application you&rsquo;re working with. This is fairly trivial to setup. Just remember
that after you set it up via the UI, you&rsquo;ll need to start it on the &ldquo;Manage
services on this server&rdquo; page, and then perform an IIS reset. Forgetting these
will keep your Managed Metadata service from working.</p>
