<h1>Jon&#39;s General SharePoint 2010 Development Tips</h1>
<p>In the time I&rsquo;ve been doing SharePoint development, and SharePoint 2010
development in particular, I&rsquo;ve tried to blog about the snags or neat stuff I&rsquo;ve
come across. This post is for all those little pieces of knowledge that come
from working with the platform that don&rsquo;t seem large enough for their own post.
If you find it useful, let me know in the comments.</p>
