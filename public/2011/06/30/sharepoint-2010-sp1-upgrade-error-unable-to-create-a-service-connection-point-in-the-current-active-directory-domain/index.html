<p>Full error: &ldquo;Unable to create a Service Connection Point in the current Active
Directory domain. Verify that the SharePoint container exists in the current
domain and that you have rights to write to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After installing SP2010 SP1, PSConfig failed and the log had the above error. I
found that the timer service was stopped and restarted it. Retried install - no
error.</p>
