<p>|- and so on with the error message. Do these also fit your situation? 1) The
error happens when running a console application 2) Using PowerShell works to
access the SPSite, SPWeb, or SPWebApplication that you&rsquo;re accessing in your
console application How do you fix this? Change your build platform target to
x64 instead of x86. Also keep in mind that this is a per build configuration
setting (so you have the setting for Debug and Release compile modes). Why did I
post this? Because every few months this bites me in some way. Normally for at
least an hour at a time. It&rsquo;s extremely confusing at first and a &lsquo;doh moment
when you figure it out.</p>
