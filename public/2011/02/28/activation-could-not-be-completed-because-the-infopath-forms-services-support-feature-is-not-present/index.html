<h1>Activation could not be completed because the InfoPath Forms Services support feature is not present.</h1>
<p>Got this error after migrating a SP2007 application to SP2010.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Activation could not be completed because the InfoPath Forms Services support
feature is not present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feature it is complaining about is a hidden feature with displayname
&ldquo;IPFSSiteFeatures&rdquo;. This feature was already enabled on the migrated
application&hellip;but resolving the error was as simple as disabling and then
re-enabling the feature. Here&rsquo;s the PowerShell to do that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">Disable-SPFeature <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;IPFSSiteFeatures&#34;</span> -url <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;http://yourwebapp&#34;</span>;
Enable-SPFeature <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;IPFSSiteFeatures&#34;</span> -url <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;http://yourwebapp&#34;</span>;
</code></pre></div>
