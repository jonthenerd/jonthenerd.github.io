<h1>Playing with Open Source Automation</h1>
<p>We&rsquo;re preparing to move into a new house and I&rsquo;ve discovered that I&rsquo;m interested
in home automation. Well&hellip; not really home automation so much as the nerdy
aspect of controlling physical things through code.</p>
<p>This is a bit scary, as home automation can be quite expensive and if not done
with an eye toward quality and usability can be very very frustrating.</p>
<p>Oh well. I was Googling the subject and found several open source home
automation controllers. One of those is
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Source Automation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s
.Net based and has a plugin system for extension. I&rsquo;m a .Net developer by day
(and some evenings and weekends&hellip;) so I found it pretty interesting. All kinds
of what-if&rsquo;s entered my brain:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Step 1 Install MySQL - Done!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Step 2 Install Open Source Automation&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Running the Installer, I got the following message: &ldquo;There is a problem with
this installer package&hellip;&quot;:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Looking at the log, this is what&rsquo;s occuring right when the error happens:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Perusing the Open Source Automation forums, I found
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->this
post talking about the same issue with the installer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It indicates that
restarting the MySQL service may resolve the issue. So I restarted the service
and&hellip;. same error.</p>
<p>The same post indicated that perhaps something else was running on port 8081 and
to use tcpview to check it out. I used it - nothing&rsquo;s running on port 8081.</p>
<p>I then found
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->this
post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which indicated that .Net 3.5 may be needed for the Web Server
software to install. I&rsquo;m running Windows 8, so this isn&rsquo;t installed by default.
Installed it. Ran the OSA installer&hellip; it worked! So yeah - .Net 3.5 is a
pre-req that the installer doesn&rsquo;t check for.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Step 3 - Get the Z-Wave USB dongle working.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Reading OSA&rsquo;s wiki, I found that
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->this
particular (older) dongle, the Intermatic HA22,  isn&rsquo;t support by the Open-ZWave
library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So much for that.</p>
<p>Guess I&rsquo;ll have to wait until I get some hardware that works with OSA&hellip; or find
some other software that might work with the Intermatic HA22. Off to Google for
that :)</p>
