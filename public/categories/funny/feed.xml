      <description>I ran across this the other day and found it funny. A google search reveals that it may be from a mailing list from around 2000.If clients treated architects like they treat software designers…Dear Mr. Architect,Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of what I need, so you should use your discretion. My house should have somewhere between two and forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms can be easily added or deleted.</description>

      <description>? Minutes ago, I started to use my Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 (v2.0)&amp;hellip;and the pointer was jumpy&amp;hellip;kinda jittery&amp;hellip;whenever I moved it left to right. Up and down was fine though. I resynced the mouse, replace the batteries, and even restarted&amp;hellip;still it was jumpy. I&amp;rsquo;ve long since lost the receipt to this mouse (which I really like&amp;hellip;would hate to replace it) - so did some searching for others who may have had this issue.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t often laugh at online videos - but this one got me. Now don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong - I love the Mac&amp;rsquo;s interface. It&amp;rsquo;s truly a wonder. But this video is absolutely hilarious :)</description>
