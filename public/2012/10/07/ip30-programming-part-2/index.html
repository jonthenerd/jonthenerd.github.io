<p>The batteries on the IP30 and CN3 are fully charged and ready for some tinkering. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Upgrading the Firmware from 3.01 to 3.16<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I looked into upgrading the firmware on the IP30 and it looks to require a MiniSD card. MiniSD is the never-mentioned step brother of SD and MicroSD&hellip; meaning stores don&rsquo;t carry it anymore. I&rsquo;ve got a MiniSD card and reader on order from Amazon&hellip; so updating the IP30 will have to wait. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Available Commands<!-- raw HTML omitted --> To receive the available commands on the IP30, the HELP command can be issued.</p>
