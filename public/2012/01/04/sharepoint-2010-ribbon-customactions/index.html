<h1>SharePoint 2010: Ribbon CustomActions</h1>
<p>Developing a CustomAction for the Ribbon and SharePoint 2010? If you&rsquo;re like
me - you follow some instructions online, deploy it once to verify it works,
then change as needed and redeploy. One catch though - the data needed for the
ribbon custom action to work is fetched by the browser and CACHED! So you won&rsquo;t
see your changes&hellip;until you clear your cache. Stupid but true. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
