<h1>Lenovo T61 Speakers popping</h1>
<p>I was fortunate to get a new laptop at work recently. I took my time on a long
weekend configuring it to my satisfaction, but was annoyed by an annoying &ldquo;pop&rdquo;
noise coming from the speakers after every sound. A little further testing
showed that this was only when the machine was on battery power.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
on notebookreview and
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->this
post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the OpenSuse forums point to incorrect power management settings for
the sound hardware. There really isn&rsquo;t much out there about this, until you
start searching for SoundMax popping issues. This led me to a new driver for the
T61 - which has fixed the popping noise. This is my first experience using
Lenovo&rsquo;s site for drivers and downloads&hellip; and it&rsquo;s great. I didn&rsquo;t have to read
through any readmes to clearly see what had changed in each driver revision -
and that a &ldquo;clicking noise&rdquo; had been fixed in a past driver revision.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is this news? No. I&rsquo;m a happy guy though and will look at Lenovo
laptops in the future from this experience. Keep it up Lenovo!</p>
