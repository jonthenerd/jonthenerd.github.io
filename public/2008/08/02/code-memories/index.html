<h1>Code Memories?</h1>
<p>Every once in a while I&rsquo;ll start thinking of long-past written code. Lately I&rsquo;ve
been thinking of C/C++&hellip; This isn&rsquo;t a language I wish to make a language
coding. In fact - many parts of my C/C++ education were /very/ lacking. However,
there are times when I think back to things that I could have done better,
things I really enjoyed coding (Blackjack console app with ASCII cards..heh),
and things I just plain didn&rsquo;t understand or care to.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quick Google
search brought up

for relearning some of that forgotten knowledge. I make a quick run through and
got as far as classes before taking a breather- which means I learned more
syntax in an hour than in my entire High School programming courses (and almost
as much as 2 semesters of Computer Science&hellip;.ug).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazing what our
brains will bring back up when we least expect it. :-/</p>
