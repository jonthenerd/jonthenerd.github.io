<h1>Boxes of Orden</h1>
<p>I just finished reading Chainfire, by Terry Goodkind. I had taken a 2 year
hiatus from reading the series and finally returned to it. If you&rsquo;re looking to
pick up recreational reading, I highly recommend the series. It starts with
&ldquo;Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule&rdquo;. Truly one of the best series of our time.</p>
