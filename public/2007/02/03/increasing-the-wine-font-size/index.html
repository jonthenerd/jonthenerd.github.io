<h1>Increasing the Wine font size</h1>
<p>Thus far in using Ubuntu, I&rsquo;ve been able to use only Linux applications. I&rsquo;ll
admit that some of them were just ports of their Windows or Mac OS X
counterparts&hellip;but I never had to install wine (a compatibility layer for
running Windows programs). Well you know that torrent app I recommended?
kTorrent? It&rsquo;s crashed on me several times in the last couple days&hellip;and ate up
every bit of memory the system had this morning. I went looking for a better
alternative and my only choice was to use uTorrent under wine. No
problem!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wine is only a synaptic click away. Running utorrent under
it is a simple affair too. I found this tutorial
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->helpful:

32&quot; LCD and I&rsquo;m at about an 8-10 foot distance from it - the font size needs to
be increased. Under windows this is a simple task&hellip;but under Wine = not so
much. I think this is something that NEEDS to be put into the wine configuration
app. Anyway - here&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s done.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First - close any applications
that are running under wine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To change the size of any menu font -
you&rsquo;ll need to edit the win.ini under the following
folder:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->/home/yourusername/.wine/<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Add
the following information to the win.ini
file:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Desktop]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->MenuFontSize=18<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You
can change the 18 to whatever size you need - but that worked for me. Now we
need to change font size of the rest of the application. To do so, use the
terminal and launch wine&rsquo;s
regedit:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->wine
regedit<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You&rsquo;ll want to browse to this
value:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG\Software\Fonts\LogPixels<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->and
change it to something larger. Make sure to change the selection to &ldquo;Decimal&rdquo;,
as you probably don&rsquo;t natively speak hex. It&rsquo;s default in decimal is 96. I upped
mine to 120 and it worked nicely.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you&rsquo;re done doing that, close
out regedit and restart your wine application. Enjoy your larger font sizes and
lack of squinting!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the best resource I found on this matter
after a bit of
searching:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.winehq.com/pipermail/wine-users/2005-April/017810.html">http://www.winehq.com/pipermail/wine-users/2005-April/017810.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
