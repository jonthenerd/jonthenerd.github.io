<h1>WinAudit - a shameless plug for a nifty tool</h1>
<p>While surfing the interwebs, checking the emails, etc. I came upon a program
called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WinAudit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a
FREEware app that can report a lot of things about your machine and output it in
a lot of different formats. Straight from their site: &ldquo;The programme has
advanced features such as service tag detection, hard-drive failure diagnosis,
network port to process mapping, network connection speed, system availability
statistics as well as WindowsÂ® update and firewall
settings.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway - it&rsquo;s pretty neat. My new employer is a &ldquo;100%
Microsoft Shop&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;m trying to move more that direction in the things I learn
about and use on a daily basis. I&rsquo;m all for open source, free software for all,
and beautiful alternative user interfaces&hellip;but managing a 100% Microsoft Shop
is surely going to have its peaks. All in all I&rsquo;m looking forward to the
opportunity. Only question I now have&hellip;should I switch my Linux server/media
box to Windows Server 2003?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you&rsquo;ve got a handy free tool for the
Windows world that makes your life easier - leave me a comment or two :)</p>
