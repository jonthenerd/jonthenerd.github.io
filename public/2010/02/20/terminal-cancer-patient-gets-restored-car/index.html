<h1>Terminal Cancer Patient gets restored car</h1>
<p>From AutoBlog: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tyler
Shipman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was an 18-year-old Fiero nut from Frazee, Minnesota. In the middle
of restoring his favorite car last October he was diagnosed with terminal
cancer, and posted a note on a Fiero forum to ask for help with the restoration
so that he wouldn&rsquo;t leave his parents with the burden. He got his wish. In the
middle of this crazy all and everything, Tyler is more proof that simple
humanity still works. We send our best to Tyler&rsquo;s family and friends. Hat tip to
Ryan.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thought I&rsquo;d reshare this - this is a very special
