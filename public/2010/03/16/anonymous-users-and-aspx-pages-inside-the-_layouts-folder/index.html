<h1>Anonymous users and aspx pages inside the _layouts folder</h1>
<p>I ran smack into an issue that was looking to be a serious problem yesterday.
One of my development projects (SharePoint) is an anonymous access public-facing
website. This site using built-in SharePoint web services and the download.aspx
page in the _layouts directory to facilitate lookup of related documents and
provide download capability. The issue? Anonymous users can&rsquo;t use any of the
application pages in the _layouts folder. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lots of head scratching
and some creative Google searches led me to the &ldquo;DotNetIdeas&rdquo; blog, specifically
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->this
post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It details how the _layouts, _controltemplates, and _vti_bin
directories are affected by allowing access to anonymous users. I recommend you
go read their post, but the key excerpt is this:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anonymous
users can never load pages inheriting from
Microsoft.SharePoint.WebContorls.LayoutsPageBase<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The answer to my
issue is to create my own download.aspx page (not overwriting the original)
without inheriting from this class. I&rsquo;d still be hunting whatever setting was
keeping anonymous users from these pages if not for that helpful post though.</p>
