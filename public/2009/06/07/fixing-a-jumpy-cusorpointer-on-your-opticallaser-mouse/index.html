<h1>Fixing a jumpy cusor/pointer on your optical/laser mouse</h1>
<p>? Minutes ago, I started to use my Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000
(v2.0)&hellip;and the pointer was jumpy&hellip;kinda jittery&hellip;whenever I moved it left to
right. Up and down was fine though. I resynced the mouse, replace the batteries,
and even restarted&hellip;still it was jumpy. I&rsquo;ve long since lost the receipt to
this mouse (which I really like&hellip;would hate to replace it) - so did some
searching for others who may have had this issue. Found this great post :

. Basically - the little diode under the mouse can get dust or hair on it and
cause this problem. Don&rsquo;t throw away your mouse, just blow some air on the
diode! Fixed mine right up&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here I was dreading going to Best
