<h1>Jon can cook...</h1>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sushi!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tonight
I tried my hand at making one of my favorite eat-out foods. This is my second
try&hellip;the first ended up in the trash can. And which roll did I make? The
classic Americanized sushi - the California Roll.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Where did I get my
inspiration? Youtube videos. Search for &ldquo;how to sushi rice&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to
california roll&rdquo; and enough instructions will appear that even the slowest of
cooks&hellip;ahem&hellip;can figure it out. I must say that the sushi I made tonight,
while not tip-top restaurant quality&hellip;was really close to it. For the amount of
sushi I can make for $5&hellip;I&rsquo;ll be eating at home for a while :)</p>
