                        ? Minutes ago, I started to use my Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 (v2.0)&hellip;and the pointer was jumpy&hellip;kinda jittery&hellip;whenever I moved it left to right. Up and down was fine though. I resynced the mouse, replace the batteries, and even restarted&hellip;still it was jumpy. I&rsquo;ve long since lost the receipt to this mouse (which I really like&hellip;would hate to replace it) - so did some searching for others who may have had this issue.

                        Tonight I tried my hand at making one of my favorite eat-out foods. This is my second try&hellip;the first ended up in the trash can. And which roll did I make? The classic Americanized sushi - the California Roll.
Where did I get my inspiration? Youtube videos. Search for &ldquo;how to sushi rice&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to california roll&rdquo; and enough instructions will appear that even the slowest of cooks&hellip;ahem&hellip;can figure it out.

                        I was fortunate to get a new laptop at work recently. I took my time on a long weekend configuring it to my satisfaction, but was annoyed by an annoying &ldquo;pop&rdquo; noise coming from the speakers after every sound. A little further testing showed that this was only when the machine was on battery power. This post on notebookreview and this post on the OpenSuse forums point to incorrect power management settings for the sound hardware.

                        Every once in a while I&rsquo;ll start thinking of long-past written code. Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking of C/C++&hellip; This isn&rsquo;t a language I wish to make a living coding. In fact - many parts of my C/C++ education were /very/ lacking. However, there are times when I think back to things that I could have done better, things I really enjoyed coding (Blackjack console app with ASCII cards..heh), and things I just plain didn&rsquo;t understand or care to.

                        I just finished reading Chainfire, by Terry Goodkind. I had taken a 2 year hiatus from reading the series and finally returned to it. If you&rsquo;re looking to pick up recreational reading, I highly recommend the series. It starts with &ldquo;Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule&rdquo;. Truly one of the best series of our time.

                        I managed to purchase one of these little gems in late April. I&rsquo;ve been a longtime fan of Linux and Asus in general, so the thought of a little laptop running the free OS was enough to keep me dreaming until I broke down and ordered one. I bought a 7&quot; model with the4 gig hard drive and an extra 2 gigs of ram. I did the ram install myself and setup the Advanced Desktop to my liking.

                        I&rsquo;ve been a gamer ever since I first laid eyes on an Atari. But of all the genres that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed - the Adventure Genre stands out the most. What games are included on this list? Pretty much all Lucas Arts games&hellip;Monkey Island (1-4), Loom, Day of the Tentacle, etc. Because of my age, these games (for the most part) came out before I was old enough to realize that I needed to go buy them.
