                        In my other life, I teach computer courses and accept assignments through an online course management system. Our school (and myself) have yet to upgrade to Office 2007, but students aren&rsquo;t wasting any time. I found an official Microsoft converter for Office 2007 formats available here:

                        Thus far in using Ubuntu, I&rsquo;ve been able to use only Linux applications. I&rsquo;ll admit that some of them were just ports of their Windows or Mac OS X counterparts&hellip;but I never had to install wine (a compatibility layer for running Windows programs). Well you know that torrent app I recommended? kTorrent? It&rsquo;s crashed on me several times in the last couple days&hellip;and ate up every bit of memory the system had this morning.

                        This isn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve tried Ubuntu (or Linux for that matter). Several times in the past few years (since 2002 actually), I&rsquo;d get the &ldquo;Linux Bug&rdquo; and repartition my hard drive to be able to try out some new distro. This would normally come about after I&rsquo;d read some positive review of said distro (or from a friend). What have I tried in the past? I started out on Mandrake (now Mandriva), moved to SUSE 8 &amp; 9, then MEPIS (great distro btw), and now Ubuntu.

                        I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with Linux more often lately and have found several blogs out there to be very helpful. I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon some pretty good information and hope to post it here when I stumble upon it from time to time.
Initially I considered paying for hosting on my own blog - just to learn the ins and outs of Wordpress or CMS Made Simple. But the truth of the matter is - I&rsquo;m more interested in tinkering with the technology than coming up with sample content.

                        I decided that in order to tinker without disrupting the smooth operation of my workhorse PC, I ought to just build a testing box. In the event that I can actually tinker enough to stop wanting to tinker (like that&rsquo;s going to happen), I also wanted the PC to serve a dual role as an eventual Media Center PC (Windows or otherwise). So I laid out some requirements:
 Multiple Core - I&rsquo;ve read that the latest versions of software that play High-Def video (DVD &amp; Blu-Ray) recommend having dual core.
