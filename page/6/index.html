This will involve removing the k-member before any of the work can be done. Most seem to do this while the engine is removed, but I&rsquo;d rather not go through that again. I&rsquo;ve been doing some reading on how to do this the safest way with the engine still in the car, and here are the tools I&rsquo;m looking at:_ OTC Spring Compressor 7045B (what the GM dealer uses)_ OTC Tools 4324 Tubular Engine Support* 4 6-ton pound jack standsIt&rsquo;s not the completed task you&rsquo;re most proud of - it&rsquo;s the tool collection you&rsquo;ve amassed.

                        Using IE8 Standards Mode with MOSS has been fairly trouble-free so far. However, the richhtmlfield editor throws javascript errors when the page is in IE8 Standards mode. Without switching to the Telerikcontrol or defaulting all of my pages to IE7 mode - there is a simpler fix!Enable IE7 compatability mode only on your edit pages. My master page had the IE8 meta tag:&lt;meta equiv=&ldquo;X-UA-Compatible&rdquo; content=&ldquo;IE=8&rdquo;&gt;right under the head element. To force your edit pages into IE7 mode, use the PublishingWebControls:EditModePanel to conditionally display it.

I took my time on a long weekend configuring it to my satisfaction, but was annoyed by an annoying &ldquo;pop&rdquo; noise coming from the speakers after every sound. A little further testing showed that this was only when the machine was on battery power. This poston notebookreview and this poston the OpenSuse forums point to incorrect power management settings for the sound hardware.
