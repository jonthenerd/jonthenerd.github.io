                        Wrote a new field control today (SharePoint) that queried a specific list in another site collection based on the value of a field from the current list item. This worked great each time I&rsquo;d test it out and add some additional functionality. When I finished the control, I did a little harder testing by hitting the refresh button in my browser over and over again. Randomly, my control wouldn&rsquo;t render. Other times it would be fine.

                        Trying to delete a field in a SharePoint library and get the message &ldquo;Cannot complete this action. Pleast try again.&rdquo;? This drove me nuts, as even invoking the delete method via the object model gives this message. What I found to allow a delete was pushing down changes via the content type gallery in the site collection (if the field was ever a part of that content type). This can be found by going to the following:

Tyler Shipman was an 18-year-old Fiero nut from Frazee, Minnesota. In the middle of restoring his favorite car last October he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and posted a note on a Fiero forum to ask for help with the restoration so that he wouldn&rsquo;t leave his parents with the burden. He got his wish. In the middle of this crazy all and everything, Tyler is more proof that simple humanity still works.

I&rsquo;ve been looking to do some modification to the k-member on my car whenever the weather warms up. This will involve removing the k-member before any of the work can be done. Most seem to do this while the engine is removed, but I&rsquo;d rather not go through that again. I&rsquo;ve been doing some reading on how to do this the safest way with the engine still in the car, and here are the tools I&rsquo;m looking at:

Dear Mr. Architect,
Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of what I need, so you should use your discretion. My house should have somewhere between two and forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms can be easily added or deleted.

                        Using IE8 Standards Mode with MOSS has been fairly trouble-free so far. However, the richhtmlfield editor throws javascript errors when the page is in IE8 Standards mode. Without switching to the Telerik control or defaulting all of my pages to IE7 mode - there is a simpler fix!
Enable IE7 compatability mode only on your edit pages. My master page had the IE8 meta tag:
&lt;meta equiv=&#34;X-UA-Compatible&#34; content=&#34;IE=8&#34; /&gt; right under the head element.
