Update: Apparently seeing products that do FTP in .NET for years made me think this wasn&rsquo;t built in. It&rsquo;s been around since .NET 2.0&hellip; Another blogger has even created a helper class that encapsulates everything you want to do in .NET with FTP (and it works on mono!).

                        I ran smack into an issue that was looking to be a serious problem yesterday. One of my development projects (SharePoint) is an anonymous access public-facing website. This site using built-in SharePoint web services and the download.aspx page in the _layouts directory to facilitate lookup of related documents and provide download capability. The issue? Anonymous users can&rsquo;t use any of the application pages in the _layouts folder. Lots of head scratching and some creative Google searches led me to the &ldquo;DotNetIdeas&rdquo; blog, specifically this post.

                        Wrote a new field control today (SharePoint) that queried a specific list in another site collection based on the value of a field from the current list item. This worked great each time I&rsquo;d test it out and add some additional functionality. When I finished the control, I did a little harder testing by hitting the refresh button in my browser over and over again. Randomly, my control wouldn&rsquo;t render. Other times it would be fine.

                        Trying to delete a field in a SharePoint library and get the message &ldquo;Cannot complete this action. Pleast try again.&rdquo;? This drove me nuts, as even invoking the delete method via the object model gives this message. What I found to allow a delete was pushing down changes via the content type gallery in the site collection (if the field was ever a part of that content type). This can be found by going to the following:_ Site Settings_ Site Content Type Gallery_ Choose Content Type_ Advanced Settings_ Make sure radio button &ldquo;Update all content types inheriting from this type&rdquo; is checked_ Click OKI had several libraries with several fields that had this issue (all fields used to be a part of the content type but had since been orphaned due to changing the definition of the content type in the elements.
